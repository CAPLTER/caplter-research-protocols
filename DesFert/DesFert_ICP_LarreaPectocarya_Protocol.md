# **DesFert (CN DEP) _Larrea_ and _Pectocarya_ Leaf Tissue Analysis by ICP-MS/OES**

Dried and milled *Larrea* and *Pectocarya* leaf tissue was microwave digested using a CEM MARSXpress. Approximately 0.2500 g of sample was allowed to react with 10mL of Trace Metal Grade nitric acid (Fisher #AS09-P212) for at least 30 minutes, uncapped, then ran on the CEM using the following method: 1600W at 100% power, ramped up to 180 degrees Celsius over the course of 15 minutes, and held at 180 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes. Samples were diluted at 100x prior to being run by ICP-MS.

Samples were analyzed using a Thermo Scientific X Series 2 quadrapole ICP-MS and Cetac ASX-520 autosampler. Sulfur was analyzed via a Thermo Scientific iCAP 6300 optical emission spectrometer. Sample introduction consisted of a conical spray chamber with impact bead and concentric nebulizer with a flow of ~1mL/min. The spray chamber was cooled to 3 degrees Celsius by a Peltier cooling system. Collision Cell Technology (CCT) mode was utilized to reduce interferences by the argon gas used to generate the plasma by using a mixture of 7% hydrogen/93% helium for the following elements: Fe, Se, As, and Ca. All other elements were run in normal mode. Internal standards (Sc, Ge, Y, In and Bi) were used to compensate for sample matrix effects and instrument variability.
