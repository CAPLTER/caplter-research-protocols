# **ADP Sample Processing Protocol**

Updated October 2022

Upon returning from the field, remove the buckets from garbage bags and wipe any soil/debris off the top, bottom, and sides of each bucket. When necessary, buckets can be left in the cold room for up to a week before weighing.

## **Dry collection:**

Wearing nitrile gloves, open the dry bucket and remove any contamination (insects, bird droppings, etc.) with 10% HCl-washed and nanopure-rinsed forceps. Ensure contaminants are noted on the field datasheet.

Using a Nanopure-rinsed 500mL graduated cylinder, add 500mL of nanopure water to the bucket.

With the lid off, swirl the water around the inside of the bucket as high as possible without any risk of spillage. Rest the lid loosely on top of the bucket (do not push lid down).

Place the bucket on the reciprocal shaker in GWC 681 for 10 minutes.

Rinse a 500mL plastic 10% HCl-rinsed bottle with a small amount of sample (~5-10mL), then pour the remaining sample from the bucket into the bottle. Record the HCl bottle number on the field datasheet.

Replace the lid on the bucket and set aside to be cleaned.


### **For ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) analysis:**

Label an ammonium centrifuge tube with "ADP", "site-D" (for dry collection, "site-W" for wet collection), and date.

Rinse the tube with a small amount of sample and then fill and cap.

Centrifuge at 8000rpm for 10min (make sure rotor is balanced).

Place the tubes in a tube rack labeled with the date and "ADP-N", then store the tubes in the freezer in GWC 639 for analysis on the Lachat flow-injection analyzer.


### **For Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) analysis:**

Using a clean, Nanopure-rinsed 25mm filter apparatus with an ashed GF/F 25mm filter, filter a small amount of sample (~5mL) to rinse and then discard.

Label a 40 mL glass DOC vial with ‘ADP’, ‘site-D’ (for dry collection; ‘site-W’ for wet), and the date.

Filter ~50 ml of sample. Rinse the vial with filtered sample, then discard the rinse and fill the DOC vial with the remaining filtrate until almost full.

Rinse the filter apparatus with nanopure before beginning the next sample.

Acidify each sample with 2 drops of concentrated HCl.

Place the samples in a tube rack labeled with the date and "ADP DOC-HCl" on a strip of tape, then store the vials in the cold room in GWC 675 until the samples can be run.


### **For anion and cation analysis:**

Label two sterile 50mL centrifuge tubes with "ADP", "site-D" (for dry collection, "site-W" for wet), and "anions" or "cations" (one of each).

Using a clean, Nanopure-rinsed 47mm filter apparatus with a Supor-450 47mm membrane filter, filter a small amount of sample (~15mL) to rinse and then discard.

Filter enough of the remaining sample to fill the two 50mL centrifuge tubes.

Fill the anion tube with ~30ml filtrate, then cap. The centrifuge tubes are sterile so do not need to be rinsed with sample prior to filling.

Repeat with the cation tube.

Rinse the filter apparatus with Nanopure before beginning the next sample.

Place the anion samples in a Styrofoam tube holder labeled with the date and "ADP Anions" on a strip of tape, then store the tubes in the cold room in the freezer in GWC639 until samples can be run (preferably within 24-48 hours of collection for reactive species).

Place the cation samples in a Styrofoam tube holder labeled with the date and "ADP Cations-Acidified" on a strip of tape and then acidify the cation samples as follows:

* Place an empty 50mL centrifuge tube on the balance and tare.
* Weigh the cation centrifuge tube on the tared balance and record the sample weight (in grams) on the datasheet.
* Multiply the weight by 20. The result equals the amount (in microliters) of trace metal grade nitric acid to add. Record this volume on the datasheet.
* Under the hood, use an adjustable pipette with a filtered pipette tip to add the acid to the samples.
* Once acidified, the samples are stored on the bench in the storage room in GWC 681.


## **Wet collection:**

Notes:

If there is less than ~10mL of sample in the wet bucket, note this on the datasheet and do not process the sample. If the sample bottle volume is limited (i.e., 10 < 155mL) or lost, note the unprocessed subsamples on the field datasheet.

In cases when there is not enough rain to complete all of the analyses, the sampling priority is as follows: ammonium/nitrate, DOC, anions, cations, pH. See the following table for volume requirements for each analysis:

Remove the wet collection bucket from the garbage bag and wipe any soil/debris off the top, bottom, and sides of each bucket.

Tare the 12kg balance in GWC 681 and weigh each bucket.

Record the total weight (in kg) on the field datasheet. Subtract the lid and bucket weights from the total weight and record the net sample weight (in g) on the field datasheet.

Perform the analyses described above for the dry collection protocol.

After the last step of the dry collection protocol, measure the pH of the sample remaining in the 500mL 10% HCl-rinsed bottle using the pH meter in GWC 677 and record on the datasheet.


## **Lab cleanup:**

Rinse, dry, and 10% HCl-wash any glassware used.

Clean buckets and lids according to the "ADP Bucket/Lid Inspection/Rinsing, Bagging, and New Bucket Prep" protocol.

Ensure an adequate supply of ashed 25mm GF/F filters (4hr in muffle furnace at 500&deg;C).

Filters can be removed from the furnace the following day.

Note: Bulk Samples - If dry buckets have collected rainwater due to a collector malfunction, process this water as a bulk sample (see ADP Sample Collection Protocol). Add the water from the wet bucket to the dry bucket, then weigh and process as a wet bucket EXCEPT swirl the sample as you would a dry bucket before proceeding.
