# **Arthropod Pitfall Trapping Lab Protocol**

Updated April 2020


The CAP LTER entomology lab is responsible for receiving and processing quarterly pitfall samples from CAP LTER sites and the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. Pitfall samples are collected in January, April, July, and October and delivered to the lab soon after collection, with 10 jars per site. The CAP LTER Entomological Research Specialist, with the help of a student worker, is responsible for separating out the arthropods from the debris in each jar and identifying the specimens to the lowest taxonomic level possible. Once identified, the samples are preserved in ethanol in a two-dram vial and stored indefinitely in the CAP LTER entomology lab.


## **Workflow**

Each quarter, about 10 boxes of Qorpak jars, containing samples from 20 sites, are delivered to the CAP LTER entomology lab by CAP LTER field staff. Once received, the Research Specialist should examine the jars to make sure all samples have been delivered and that all jars are sealed tightly to prevent evaporation of ethanol. Inside each box are data sheets compiled during collection with notes about each site (traps missing, lizards released from traps, inaccessibility of site, etc.).

### **Student Worker Duties**

* Start by creating a new sampling event in the appropriate database (LTER 10 arthropods or McDowell arthropods), entering the site location, date of collection and any collection notes from the data sheets in the appropriate sample (i.e., pitfall trap) number.

* Next, organize the pitfall sample jars received to ensure that only one site is being worked on at a time. Each jar will contain a label signifying the site, date, and pitfall trap number it was collected from. Working on one jar at a time, place this label in a clean one-dram vial and fill the vial with ethanol.

* Each pitfall sample jar will contain ethanol, arthropods, and debris from the environment, which can include leaves, rocks or even incomplete insect parts. Empty the jar by pouring the contents into a petri dish and remove any remaining debris with forceps, placing it into the petri dish. Using a squeeze bottle of ethanol, rinse out the jar to ensure that all matter is extracted from the jar and moved into the petri dish.

* Under low magnification on the microscope and using forceps, remove the debris from the petri dish and discard, taking special care to make sure no arthropods are trapped in the debris, especially on the leaves.

* Once the debris is removed, first search for arthropods on low magnification to remove larger specimens and then increase the magnification to find smaller specimens. At higher magnification two passes should be performed to ensure all arthropods have been successfully removed. Place all arthropods separated out from the debris in the previously labeled vial for this pitfall trap. Consult with the Research Specialist if there is any uncertainty about whether an item in the debris is actually a specimen, or err on the side of caution and include the item in the vial for later evaluation.

* Once all debris and specimens have been removed from the petri dish, pour the remaining ethanol into a hazardous waste container and place the jar in the sink to be washed. Assuming all ten pitfall traps were collected, the result from each site will be ten 1-dram vials with arthropods for the Research Specialist to identify.


### **Expanded Student Worker Duties**

* Once the student has gained experience and is comfortable with the process above, the Research Specialist should teach the student how to identify the groups commonly found in abundant numbers in the samples. At minimum, these groups will include Collembola and Acari as identification is done only to the Family level and having to sort through these samples twice (once by the student and once by the Research Specialist) is unnecessarily time-consuming and redundant. Keys and specimen images from a student-specific Dropbox folder should be shared with the student to aid them in identifications. So as not to overwhelm the student, it is best to share this folder in increments as their identification skills progress.

* In some groups, such as Collembola, there may be hundreds of specimens per jar. Once a significant number of specimens is present (~100), sample a subset to count the specimens. Divide the petri dishes into four quadrants, count the number of individuals in one quadrant and multiply by four. Ensure that the specimens are evenly distributed to get the most accurate count.

* Upon identification of the first samples from a site, which will generally be the groups identified by the student, use an eleventh vial, this time a two-dram vial, to store all the identified specimens from each site. Create a label for this vial containing the site, number of pitfall traps included (e.g., #1-10), date collected, Research Specialist's name and the year the sample was identified. Before adding specimens, place this label into the vial, but along the outer edge so it can be read from the outside.

* The student worker is responsible for entering their identifications into the database under their name in the sampling event they have previously created.

* If a student shows good aptitude in identification, they may be capable of performing identification of further groups. This is on a case-by-case basis as determined by the Research Specialist. Other large groups that can be considered for student identification are Lepismatidae, Meinertellidae, Ispoda, and Scorpiones.


### **Research Specialist Duties**

* Ideally, the Research Specialist should spend their time identifying the unknown samples separated out by the student but may also have to assist with sorting each quarter and, in this case, should follow the student protocol.

* If the student has not started a two-dram vial to store all the identified specimens from the site, follow the instructions above for labeling this vial.

* To begin the identification process, open the database entry created by the student for the specific site and quarter for the sample and review the student notes to ensure all vials are present. Notes such as "empty" or "disturbed trap" will explain missing vials.

* Working on one vial at a time, empty the specimens out of the vial and into a petri dish, rinse the vial with ethanol and ensure that all specimens have been removed and that none are stuck to the label.

* When identifying and counting specimens, do not count exoskeletons or random head capsules, wings, legs, etc., but do count pieces of arthropods when the majority of the specimen is present.

* If the jar has been sorted correctly there will only be arthropods in the petri dish, but always check for any extraneous material and remove it from the dish. Using written or online identification keys, begin identifying specimens. Remove the larger specimens first to identify, as they may hide smaller specimens underneath them. For example, identify beetles first, then ants, and finally groups like Collembola and Acari. When identifying groups that are less familiar, sort the groups out initially and identify multiple species at once to become familiar with new keys.

* Use images of past identifications, which are stored in the Entomology Lab Dropbox, to verify an identification. For species without images on file, use the SCAN Symbiota database or BugGuide.net to access images for identification confirmation.

* In some groups, such as Collembola, there may be hundreds of specimens per jar. Once a significant number of specimens is present (~100), sample a subset to count the specimens. Divide the petri dishes into four quadrants, count the number of individuals in one quadrant and multiply by four. Ensure that the specimens are evenly distributed to get the most accurate count.

* As the specimens are identified, enter the lowest taxonomic rank and their specimen counts into the database and place the specimens into the two-dram vial. Each two-dram vial will hold all the specimens from each site for that specific quarter.

* Once all the specimens from a site have been identified, store the two-dram vial with all others from that quarter, arranged in alphabetical order by site name.


### **Camera**

* Use the camera to create images of new arthropod identification. To use the camera, connect the USB cord to the computer and turn the camera on.

* Using the program EOS Utility, click on the icon and select the third option "Camera setting/remote shooting," which will open a new window shown in the picture to the right. Towards the bottom of that window, there is a row of four icons. Select the third icon, which looks like a box with lines radiating out from it, and a window for remote shooting will open.

* On the back of the microscope, push in the silver piece to close the eye piece and the image will appear on the computer screen. Zoom in to allow you to best focus the image.

* Click on the large button on the window shown to the right to take the picture, which is automatically saved into the My Pictures folder. Rename the picture including size, site, and sample date.

* Use photo editing software to improve the picture if needed.
