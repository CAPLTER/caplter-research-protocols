# **ADP Sample Collection Protocol**

Last updated February 2017


One collector is currently operating on the roof of the Life Science-A building on campus (LSA). A key is in the top right drawer of the lab desk in LSA 311 (Grimm Lab) and is labeled "Roof" with green tape.

### **Supplies:**

* Buckets (weighed, bagged & labeled)
* Lids (weighed, bagged & labeled)
* Backpack with field datasheets & instructions, cleaning cloths/sponges, sandpaper, wire brush and/or water bottle, screwdriver, mineral oil, and Vaseline

### **Field Procedure/Sampling Schedule:**

Dry buckets are changed monthly, all on the same day (Third Tuesday of each month).  

Wet buckets are collected/changed according to the following rules:

* Collect a sample after EVERY rainfall event.
* If a series of storms is expected over a period of days, wait until the storms are over to collect.

Once collected, buckets should be prepped right away. If this is not possible, then buckets may be placed in the cold room in GWC675 to wait for prepping.  

Be careful not to contaminate the old or new bucket. If the sample is spilled or bucket dropped at any time, especially if the rim of the bucket or lid contacts any surfaces, make a note.  

### **Changing the wet side bucket:**

To ensure the collector is working properly, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or the wire brush and watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. The lid seal pad should rest snugly on the dry side bucket. See troubleshooting section below if there is a problem.  

Examine the wet side bucket carefully for contamination suck as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the datasheet.  

Using the plastic bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the wet side bucket.  

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.  

On the datasheet, record initials, time, date, amount of rain in rain gauge, lid label & weight, old bucket label & weight, new bucket label, and contaminants.  

After recording the amount of rain, empty the contents of the rain gauge.  

While the roof is still covering the dry side bucket, wipe the top of the roof, sensor, and around the buckets to remove bird droppings, dirt, etc. that could contaminate the sample bucket.  

Using the plastic bag as a glove, place the new wet side bucket in the bucket holder.  

Blow off any excess water on the sensor if necessary, waiting until th roof moves back to the wet side.  

Place the securely closed bucket into the bag the clean bucket was in.  


### **Changing the dry side bucket:**

Examine the dry side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the datasheet.  

Using the bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the dry side bucket.  

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.  

On the datasheet, record initials, time, date, lid label, old bucket label, new bucket label, and contaminants.  

Inspect the battery in its housing and check the voltage with a volt meter and record on the data sheet. The voltage should be above 13V. If not, it may be time to replace the battery with a new one.  

To ensure the collector is working properly, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or the wire brush and watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. See troubleshooting section below if there is a problem.  

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.  

Beforew replacing the dry bucket and with the roof covering the wet side bucket, wipe the top of the roof, sensor, and around the buckets to remove bird droppings, dirt, etc. that could contaminate the sample bucket.  

Using the bag as a glove, place the new dry side bucket in the bucket holder.  

Place the securely closed bucket into the bag the clean bucket was in.  


### **Changing both buckets:**

To ensure the collector is working properly, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or the wire brush and watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. The lid seal pad should rest snugly on the dry side bucket. See troubleshooting section below if there is a problem.  

Examine the wet side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the datasheet.  

Using the bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the wet side bucket.  

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.  

On the datasheet, record initials, time, date, amount of rain in rain gauge, lid label & weight, old wet bucket label & weight, new wet bucket label, and contaminants.  

After recording the amount of rain, empty the contents of the rain gauge.  

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.  

Examine the dry side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the datasheet.  

Using the bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the dry side bucket.  

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.  

On the datasheet, record the lid label, old dry bucket label, new dry bucket label, and contaminants.  

Now that both buckets have been removed, wipe the top of the roof, sensor, and around the buckets to remove bird droppings, dirt, etc. that could contaminate the sample buckets.  

Using the bag as a glove, place the new dry side bucket in the bucket holder.  

Again, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or wire brush, and then using the bag as a glove, place the new wet side bucket in the bucket holder.  

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.  

Place the securely closed buckets into the bags the clean buckets were in.  

If the sensor, motor, or battery is not working and the rook has stuck allowing water in the dry or both sides, pour all sample into the dry bucket, record on the field sheet that this is a "bulk" sample (i.e. wet and dry composition combined), and then put the collector in "bulk sample mode (wet bucket is exposed). If the collector motor box will not move the lid, reach under the main frame of the collector and push the clutch arm counter-clockwise. The clutch will disengage and the lid mechanism will be free of the drive system. Manually position the lid over the dry side bucket and use the bucket retaining springs to secure the lid. Disconnect the collector from the power supply.  


### **Troubleshooting Tips for ADP Collector:**

If the collector fails to operate, try the following:

* Check power source.
* Battery: Check for corrosion of battery cable connections at battery and at motor. Many times the connectors at the battery become corroded, resulting in a bad connection. Sending the connectors clean will solve this problem. Check battery voltage, battery may be dead. If the connectors at the motor are the problem, sand clean, apply Vaseline and reconnect.
* Check wet sensor. Replace with a spare and see if collector operates. If not, then the motor is bad and must be replaced. A faulty motor box is usually indicated by one of four things:
   * Upon a "wet" sense, the roof cycles continuously back and forth.
   * Upon a "dry" sense, the roof cycles continuously back and forth.
   * The motor does not run at all, even when the crank arm is placed in a vertical position by hand.
   * The temperature of the sensor plate is HOT when the collector is in the "dry" collection state.

All of these conditions indicate that one of the mercury wetted switches within the motor is faulty. Unfortunately, Aerochem Metrics, the company that manufactured the ADP collectors, no longer exists and collectors of this type are no longer made. The only remedy is to remove the motor, which comes off as a unit, and replace it with a spare. If no spares are available, then it may be necessary to purchase the new-type collector manufactured by N-CON Systems [here](http://www.n-con.com/Products/ads.html).
