# **ESCA (Survey200) Soil Sampling and Processing Protocol**

Updated by R. Erickson 2/17

## **Soil Sampling:**

Samples for chemical analyses: (nitrogen, carbon, moisture content, soil organic matter content). Sample soil 10 meters from the plot center at north, east, south, and west directions using 1 inch diameter, 12 inch deep slide hammer soil cores. Retrieve the plastic liner from metal core and cap both ends. Use blue cap for bottom of core and red cap for top of core.

Note: if sample point is paved or not safe to sample soil, move to the nearest possible position; record the sample position on the field sheet and with the GPS.

Samples for pH, conductivity, bulk density, and soil texture determination: One meter north from the center, use 2 inch diameter, 6 inch long slide hammer soil core to take one intact soil core for bulk density analysis.

Note: you must obtain an intact core so you can get both the soil weight and soil volume.


## **Processing Bulk Density Soils (2 inch core):**

Record height of soil in core tube (in cm) from the bottom up. Leave caps on. Blue cap is bottom, red is top. Measure 2 opposite sides and take the average. Record site and location information.

Wearing nitrile gloves, use a large wooden dowel to carefully remove red cap. Push up on the end of the cap with the dowel (saves wear and tear on your fingers). If soil is loose, use dowel to loosen cap, then twist off with your hand holding core tube upright to prevent spillage.

Tare large aluminum tray on the 12kg balance in GWC681. Empty contents of core tube into tray and record weight. If contents don't readily empty from core tube, you will have to scoop out soil with a spatula, or try pushing out with large dowel. Tapping the side of the core tube with the large dowel sometimes dislodges the core.

After weighing, carefully dump soil from large tray into small aluminum baking pan. Take the taped label off the core tube and stick it firmly on the pan for identification. Let the pan + soil sit at room temp for 1 week.

### After one week:

Empty contents of small baking pan into 2mm sieve and sieve by shaking side-to-side. Use large rubber stopper to break up large soil chunks and force them through sieve. If the chunks are too hard to break up with stopper, use a large mortar and pestle. Empty soil into mortar and pound large soil chunks with pestle to break them down. Use a circular motion to grind them further if necessary. The object here is to loosen soil stuck to the stones. DO NOT grind stones to powder! Pick out any vegetable matter (roots, twigs, grass, leaves) with tweezers and set aside. Empty contents from mortar into 2mm sieve and re-sieve. Repeat as necessary until only stones greater than 2mm are left in the sieve.

Empty stones into a large aluminum tray that has been tared on the 12kg balance and record weight. Discard. Empty contents of receiving pan (the stuff that went through the sieve - this is less than 2mm and is considered soil) into tared tray on 12kg balance and record weight. Weigh vegetable matter on the small 3100g balance and record, then discard. The stone and soil weights will be used to calculate bulk density.

Tare a small aluminum weighing pan on the 3100g balance and record weight. Put subsample of sieved soil (about 3 spatula scoops) into weighing pan and re-weigh. Record weight. Put pan + soil into 60 deg C oven for 48 hours. After 48 hours, remove pan + soil from oven and let cool 30 minutes in a desiccator. Then weigh again on 3100g balance. Record weight. Then place pan + soil into 105 deg C oven for 24 hours. After 24 hours, remove pan + soil from oven and let cool 30 minutes in a desiccator. Reweight and record weight. These data will be used to calculate moisture content.

After subsampling for moisture content, empty soil in small aluminum tray in labeled quart-size Ziploc bag. Store in sweater box. This is the bulk density soil sample that will be used for texture (particle size) analysis and soil pH and conductivity.

Calculate total soil dry weight (g) = wt. of soil >2mm + wt. of soil <2mm.

Calculate bulk density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) = total soil weight calculated above divided by volume of soil in 2 inch core (v = 3.14 x core radius squared x height of soil in core).

## **Processing 1 inch Core Samples (for chemical analyses):**

Each site will have 4 cores. For each core, record height of soil in core tube (in cm) from the bottom up. Blue cap is bottom, red is top. If necessary, measure 2 opposite sides and take the average. Record site and location information.

Separate core into 2 segments: top (0-10cm) and bottom (10cm-bottom of core). Do this as follows: wearing nitrile gloves, use a wooden dowel with 10cm marked off at one end to extrude the core into a labeled quart-size Ziploc bag. Extrude up to the 10cm mark, separate the core, and then extrude the remaining core into another labeled Ziploc bag. If core does not extrude easily or at all, mark the 10cm location on the core tube with a piece of tape. Use a plastic spatula to scoop the top core segment into a plastic weighing pan, and then dump the contents of the pan into the Ziploc bag. Empty the bottom core segment into the other bag. Several taps on the core tube with the dowel is usually sufficient to dislodge the core. If the core is very moist, it may not slide out, and you will have to use a plastic spatula to scoop is out. A combination of scooping and tapping will eventually get it out. If the core is particularly dry and loose, leave the bottom cap on to prevent spills.

Once the core has been separated into 2 bags, tare the 12kg balance with an empty Ziploc bag, then weigh both top and bottom bags and record the fresh weight.

Wearing nitrile gloves, homogenize the soil in each bag by breaking up core chunks with your hand. If there is a lot of material in the bag, transfer it to a gallon-size Ziploc for homogenizing, then back to the quart-size bag. If the core chunks are difficult to break up with your hands, pounding them with the pestle makes this task much easier.

Sieve soil in each bag using 2mm sieve. Use large rubber stomper to break up soil chunks and force them through sieve. Place soil in receiving pan back in bag and discard material greater than 2mm. You may not be able to sieve soil that is too moist. In this case, homogenize the soil as best as you can, taking care to remove as many stones as possible, along with roots, twigs, and other vegetable matter.

Tare a small aluminum weighing pan on the 3100g balance and record weight. Put subsample of sieved soil into weighing pan and reweigh. Record weight. Put pan + soil into 60 deg C oven for 48 hours. After 48 hours, remove pan + soil from oven and let cool 30 minutes in a desiccator. Then weigh again on 3100g balance. Record weight. Then place pan + soil into 550 deg C muffle furnace for 2 hours. After 2 hours, shut off furnace and open the door a crack , and leave soil to cool until the following day. Remove pan + soil from furnace and place in 60 deg C oven for 48 hours. After 48 hours, remove pan + soil from oven and let cool 30 minutes in a desiccator. Reweigh and record weight. These data will be used to calculate moisture and organic matter content.

Take all empty core tubes and caps to the sink and wash with tap water. Scrub the insides of the core tubes with a test tube brush. This task is easier if you let the tubes and caps soak in the sweater box filled with water. Do not remove this box, as it is used as a sediment trap to keep the drain from clogging with soil.

Store processed soils (bagged and labeled) in the cold room in GWC673. These samples will be used to determine available soil nitrogen, total carbon and nitrogen, inorganic carbon, and soluble reactive (available) phosphorus.
