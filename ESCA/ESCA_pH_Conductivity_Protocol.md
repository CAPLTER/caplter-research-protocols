# **ESCA (Survey200) pH and Conductivity Protocol**

Updated by R. Erickson, February 2017

Note: use Survey200 bulk density soils for this analysis

**First calibrate the Accumet pH meter:**

* In pH mode, press setup, which shows percent slope of last calibration.

* Press setup again to access the clear buffers option.

* Press enter to clear the buffers used in the previous calibration.

* Immerse rinsed electrode in pH 7 buffer, press std, then press std again to start calibration. When the buffer has been accepted, repeat with the pH 10 buffer.

* If the percent slope is outside the range of 90-102, the meter will display 'electrode error' and will not return to the Measure screen until you press enter. Repeat calibration process until slope is in range.

* When calibration is successful, the meter will return to the Measure screen. To measure pH, place rinsed electrode in soil sample and press enter.


**pH measurement:**

* Calibrate the electrode at the start of each day. Use pH 7 and 10 buffers (unless soil pH expected to be <7, in which case use 4 & 7 buffers).

* Take soil bag & invert several times to ensure sample well-mixed. Scoop soil from the center of the bag (not off the top).

* Weigh 20g (+/- 0.1g) of soil into a small beaker. Add 20mL of nanopure water.

* Batches of 15-30 samples should be weighed & mixed together to maximize efficient use of lab time.

* Mix soil-water well using a glass rod. Try & break up any clods. Set timer & leave to sit for 20 mins. Stir again. Leave for 10 minutes more.

* Rinse electrode with nanopure water, gently blot dry with a Kimwipe, set in sample & stir **GENTLY (DO NOT GRIND ELECTRODE INTO SEDIMENT AT BOTTOM OF CUP)**.  Allow electrode to rest near bottom of sample until reading is stable.

* Record pH on datasheet, rinse electrode, and repeat with next sample.

* At the end of the day, close the top ring on the electrode (twist to right) and place in the storage solution.


**Conductivity Measurement:**

* Calibrate the electrode with 1413 &mu;Seimens solution.

* Stir sample in beaker until homogenized.

* Insert the electrode into the soil slurry and stir gently, then let sit and wait for conductivity measurement to equilibrate.

* Rinse the electrode with deionized water. Make sure all sediment has been removed.


**Moisture Content:**

* Weigh an aluminum oven pan; record weight.

* Add 10-20 grams of soil to pan and place in 60 degree C oven for at least 40 hours.

* Remove pans from oven and place in dessicator until cool. Record weight.

* Place pans in 105 degree oven for at least 24 hours.

* Place pans in dessicator until cool and record weight.


Notes:

Careful storage of the pH electrode is essential. Store overnight in pH 7 buffer in a beaker covered with parafilm. For weekend storage and longer use the electrode cap, filled with pH 7 for short periods (few days) or in pH 4 buffer (Electrode Storage Solution) for longer periods.

If necessary, refill the electrode with the special solution and open the top ring on the electrode barrel (twist to left).
