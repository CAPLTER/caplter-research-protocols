**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** Water Quality – Data Entry

Updated: 8/18/2022

**Purpose**

This SOP provides information for entering data from field measurements
and lab results for water quality analysis from Tres Rios wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

None

**Materials**

- Data book

- tr_waterquality_fielddata.csv excel sheet

- Relevant TresRios_OrangeMall datasheet from GEL

- GEL file cheat sheet card

**Procedures**

Tip: use the GEL notecard to help you navigate which lab results go with
which column in the Tres Rios file. There are a lot of outputs in the
Lachat and Shimadzu spreadsheets, some we won’t use and some will differ
by name. Always double check that the values align with the correct
sample number and result type.

**Important!!!** Datasheets from GEL are community files across CAP
staff. It is crucial that no data is lost and that it stays in its
original format. **DO NOT** save any changes that you make to the
datasheet (i.e. Filter and Sort, new sheets.)

- Freeze top rows of each datasheet to avoid mistakes when entering
  data.

- First, we will focus on entering the data from the field book.

- Fill in columns A – E to match the amount of new entries you have. You
  may need to consult the Tres Rios binder to make sure your sample and
  doc ID match up.

- Data that was collected in the field will be entered into columns for
  pH (O) – o2 percent (T).

- Initial the page once completed.

- Now for the GEL water quality results. Open the GEL file that
  associates with which results you need to enter and for which dates.

  - These files are continuously updated so it is important you keep
    track of them as they are created. Since they are coming from GEL,
    there will be results from other locations and samples as well.

  - The GEL files are labeled with abbreviations for project sample type
    (TR/Tres Rios, OM/Orange Mall, SW/Stormwater), Analyte type, and
    date of the sample)

- In the GEL file, the sample ID will correspond with the same sample
  and doc ID in the Tres Rios folder

- Use the “Sort and Filter’ function to filter by sample ID and only see
  Tres Rios (TR) results. This function will also help you sort between
  analyte type (column Q) to match the results you would like transfer
  into the Tres Rios folder.

**Tot P / Tot N**

- Tot P and Tot N in the GEL file correspond to “tp” and “tn” in the
  Tres Rios file

- Freeze top rows of each datasheet to avoid mistakes when entering
  data.

- “Sort and Filter” by sample ID to only see Tres Rios (TR) results.

- Align the corresponding sample ID’s in the GEL folder to the sample
  ID’s in the TR water quality file.

- Copy/paste the Results (column D) from the GEL file to the the Tres
  Rios file (columns F and G). Make sure that the dates and sample ID’s
  are in the correct order.

- \*\*\* Tot N and TDN differ in that Tot N is from and unfiltered
  sample and TDN is from a filtered sample. TN results should always be
  \> or = TDN results. \*\*\*

**DOC / TDN**

- You will be focusing on the Sample ID and Results column from the GEL
  file. It may be helpful to “Hide” other columns to condense your
  workspace.

- Freeze top rows of each datasheet to avoid mistakes when entering
  data.

- “Sort and Filter” by sample ID to only see Tres Rios (TR) results.

- Copy/paste the results into a NEW excel file or sheet

- Now, use the “Text to Columns” feature to separate the numerical
  results from the text.

- Highlight the data Delimited Space, Other: : NPOC : Do not import
  (skip), TN : Do not import (skip) Finish repeat to remove mg/L from
  the numbers by setting “Other : m”

<!-- -->

- Copy/paste the numerical results into the Tres Rios file (columns H
  and I). Make sure that the dates and sample ID’s are in the correct
  order.

<!-- -->

- Do not save any changes to the GEL file.

**NH<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, Cl, and
PO<sub>4</sub>**

- These spreadsheets will have a different format than those mentioned
  above.

- Freeze top rows of each datasheet to avoid mistakes when entering
  data.

- You will need columns:

  - Sample ID – A

  - Sample type – B

  - Analyte type – Q

  - Conc x ADF x MDF – AB

- “Sort and Filter” by sample ID to only see Tres Rios (TR) results.

- “Sort and Filter” by Analyte type to only one set of results at a
  time.

- Copy/paste the values into the corresponding analyte column in the
  Tres Rios file (columns J – N)
