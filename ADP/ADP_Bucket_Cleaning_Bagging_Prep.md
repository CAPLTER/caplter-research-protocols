# **ADP Bucket Cleaning, Bagging and Prep**

Updated February 2017  

### **Inspection:**

* Wipe any moisture, dirt and debris off the outside of all buckets and lids with a dry paper towel.
* Inspect for cracks, chips, stains, and rust on the handle. If the weight appears to have changed (e.g. been chipped) but is still good, be sure to reweigh, re-label, and circle the defect.
* Check that the ID and weights are still visible and legible. If necessary, rewrite with a sharpie and allow the ink to dry.


### **Rinsing:**

* Put on a pair of nitrile gloves and thoroughly rinse them with nanopure.
* Rinse the exterior of the bucket/lid with nanopure to loosen any contamination. Use the small scrub brush if necessary.
* Rinse the interior of the bucket/underside of the lid with nanopure.
* Rinse the natural sponge thoroughly with nanopure, and then wipe the interior surface. Use the small scrub brush if necessary.
* Rinse the interior surface with nanopure water four times, 1/4 turn between each rinse.
* Set upside down on the drying cart, or on white paper towels on the counter.
* Buckets will dry within 24 hours if air is allowed to circulate inside (e.g. by resting on the handle of a neighboring bucket.


### **Bagging:**

* Using 13-gallon bags for buckets and 4-gallon bags for lids (if available) place the buckets/lids into a new plastic garbage bag by using the outside of the bag as gloves.
* Buckets should have the open end towards the bottom of the bag.
* Vacuum the air out of the bag and close with a twist tie.


### **New bucket prep:**

* Clean new buckets as described above under "Rinsing".
* Fill bucket with DI water. While filling, add 1mL of 0.6N HNO<sub>3</sub> solution (38.2mL conc. HNO<sub>3</sub>/L) uising a rinsed pipet tip. Fill bucket to 2cm below the rim.
* Place a clean lid on top of the bucket and set aside for 7 days to leach.
* After 7 days, clean the bucket again as described under "Rinsing".
* Tare the 12kg balance in GWC681 and weigh, recording the weight twice on the side and once on the bottom of buckets/top of lids.
