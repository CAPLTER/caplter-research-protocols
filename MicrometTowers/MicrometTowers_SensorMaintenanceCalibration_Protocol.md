# **Micromet Towers Sensor Maintenance and Calibration Procedure**

Updated November 2018

The following sensors are installed on the met towers at LDP and DBG:

Apogee CS300 pyranometer: periodically, check level of pyranometer and remove dust and debris with a camel hair brush. **Recalibrate every 2 years.** Obtain a Return Materials Authorization (RMA) from Campbell Scientific at the phone number below before returning to them for recalibration.

RM Young 05103 anemometer: periodically, do a visual/audio inspection of the anemometer at low wind speeds. Verify that the propeller and wind vane bearing rotate freely. Inspect the sensor for physical damage. Replace bearings when they become noisy, or wind speed threshold (1.0 m/s) increases above an acceptable level. The condition of the bearings can be checked with a paper clip as described in the manual. Campbell recommends replacing the bearings yearly. The potentiometer has a life expectancy of 50 million revolutions. As it becomes worn, the element can produce noisy signals or become non-linear. Replace the potentiometer when noise or non-linearity becomes unacceptable. Campbell recommends this be done every two years.

Texas Electronics TR-525USW rain gauge: check funnel for debris periodically and remove if necessary. Calibration can be done if necessary in the field with the FC-525 field calibration kit. If factory calibration is required, return to Campbell Scientific after first obtaining an RMA by contacting them at their phone number below. Campbell recommends annual recalibration.

Vaisala HMP45C T/RH probe: periodically, clean radiation shield of debris, and check that black screen at end of sensor is free of contaminants. It can be rinsed with DI water if necessary. **Recalibrate annually** by sending to Campbell Scientific after obtaining an RMA from them by contacting them at their phone number below.
