# **Arthropod Pitfall Trapping Protocol**

Updated March 2020


## **Trap Installation:**   

Pitfall trap holes can be cored using a small soil corer or an auger, usually in turf, or dug out using a pick or a soil knife along with a sledge hammer and a small spade, in more difficult-to-excavate soil such a desert hardpan. Traps are lined with 4" PVC sewer pipe cut to a length of 5 inches, which will accept an 18oz plastic cup. The trap lining and the plastic cup should be flush with the ground.

There should be 10 traps at each site. If the number drops below this, please let the CAP LTER Site Manager know. Traps are usually ~5 meters apart on a straight line, except at residential sites. When not set, traps are covered with a 4" sewer pipe cap (lid). Lids are spray-painted green for traps located in lawns.


### **Agricultural Sites (currently there are none):**   

At agricultural sites, there are no pipes in the ground. For each visit, a fresh trap line is dug into the dirt. Plastic cups are doubled-up and placed in each hole, flush with the ground, and then removed after collection. During a given collection cycle, a maximum of two ag sites can be disregarded if the collection is not successful (due to irrigation, tilling, or other disturbance).


## **Trapping:**   

Traps are set (opened) on Day 1 and collected (closed) on Day 4 each quarter (January, April, July, and October). It does not matter in what order the pitfall sites are visited but the sites are grouped geographically. Take a few extra 4" sewer pipes into the field each time. Sometimes the pipes get dug out of the ground by animals or humans and need to be replaced.

Do not set traps when it is raining, when heavy rain is expected, or when flood irrigation is due. If there is water in the cup (from rain or landscape watering), a piece of plankton netting is used to filter out the water. After filtering the water, always rinse the netting into the jar with a wash bottle to collect any insects that may have stuck to it (even if you can't see any insects).

Scorpions may be encountered at the desert sites - take caution when removing the trap lids, when removing the cup from the ground (they are sometimes found underneath the cup on the ground in the pipe), and when collecting the trap.

**A minimum of 7 traps must be collected on Day 4**, otherwise that location should be resert or disregarded for that collection cycle.


## **Field Equipment Checklist:**

* 4" soil corer
* Auger
* Pick
* Soil knife
* Hand spade
* Small sledge hammer
* Measuring tape
* 4" sewer pipe
* Lids for pipe
* 18oz plastic cup

### _For trap setting:_

* Pitfall traps folder (contains directions, maps, residential access forms)
* Bucket for collecting trap lids
* Large tweezers
* Extra 18oz plastic cups
* Extra 4" sewer pipes
* Hand spade
* For agricultural sites: auger, pickaxe, soil knife, sledge hammer, plastic cups

### _For trap collecting:_

* Pitfall traps folder
* Bucket with trap lids
* Large tweezers
* 4oz 70% ethanol-filled kill jars (1 for each trap set)
* Plankton netting (200&mu;m or smaller)
* Water-filled wash bottle
* Jar labels
* Field data sheets


## **Field/Lab Procedure:**

Day 1: Setting traps

Remove the lid from the trap and ensure the plastic cup is clean and free of any debris or dead insects. If the cup is missing, very dirty, or damaged, replace with a new one. Cups can also be removed at the time of collection and replaced when traps are set the following quarter. Collect the trap lids and bring back to the lab until traps are collected on Day 4. Take note if any lids are missing so that you can replace it/them to ensure that there is a lid for each trap when you return to close the traps on Day 4.

### **Agricultural Sites (currently there are none):**

At ag sites, dig a fresh trap line into the dirt and use TWO cups, one to "hold" the place and the other inside it to "collect" the arthropods. Ag site traps are placed lengthwise along the "toe" of one berm, not on the crest of berms, or across the crop spaces between berms. This is done to minimize the likelihood of the cups filling with water if the field gets irrigated, but still capture arthropods that inhabit the crop area.


### **Prior to leaving for collection:**

Fill kill jars about halfway with a diluted ethanol solution. The solution is prepared in GWC681 in gallon jugs with 70% 200 proof (pure) ethanol, 30% deionized water. If more ethanol is needed, please inform CAP Research Specialist Senior.

Print jar labels (with date field filled in) and field data sheets. Jar labels and field data sheets are in the Dropbox folder at Dropbox (ASU)\research\Pitfalls\field_datasheets_maps_labels.


### **Day 4: Collecting**

If lizards are found in the cup, release them and note their presence on the data sheet. Identify the lizard if possible (including lifestage and sex) or take a photo for documentation and email with location and date to the CAP Site Manager to be included in AZG&F report.

If there is water in the cup (from rain or landscape watering), a piece of plankton netting is used to filter out the water. After filtering the water, always rinse the netting into the jar with a wash bottle to collect any insects that may have stuck to it (even if you can't see any insects).

Pour the ethanol solution in the cup and swirl. Pour the contents of the cup into the jar and insert the appropriate jar label (labels can also be inserted while filling the jars).

Replace the lid (green for grass, white otherwise), piling rocks on top of the lids in desert areas to help keep the lids on until the next collection cycle. At ag sites, remove the cups and bring back to the lab.

Enter appropriate information for each site on the field data sheet (including type of crop at ag sites) and return with the specimen jars to the arthropod lab (LSA302).
