# **DesFert (CN DEP) Soil pH Protocol**

## **Equipment needed:**

* Three small beakers for pH calibration
* pH bufers (4, 7, and 10)
* pH meter + electrode
* plastic sampling cups (in which you measure your sample)
* DI water for mixing and in quirt bottle for rinsing electrode
* Optional: 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> for research comparing historical pH values

## **Procedure:**

(Be sure to do while soil samples are still fresh!)

1. Mix a 2:1 ratio (by weight) of DI water and pre-sieved soil into a slurry (usually 30 mL water to 15g soil). If the soil is highly organic, you may need to increase this ratio.

2. Wait 30 minutes before taking pH reading on samples. Individual samples should be started ~ 2 minutes apart to insure pH measurements are done for each sample at 30 min. During this time, calibrate the pH meter. Consult pH meter manual for calibration methods (also, see below).

3. Measure the pH of the soil slurry using a calibrated portable pH meter (be extremely careful with the tip of the probe!! Don't break it!). Press measure and wait until the pH meter has stabilized (stopped blinking) before you record the value.

4. Rinse electrode (including the bottom!) with DI water into a waste beaker between samples and dry with kim wipe, but do not touch the bulb.

5. Every 10 samples, check calibration in pH 7.00 buffer. If reading is off +/- 0.05 or more, recalibrate the meter.

6. When finished, clean probe with DI water and place in probe storage solution (salt solution).

7. Again, if you are doing lots of soil samples, make sure that you are waiting only 30 minutes before each reading (plan so that your timing is correct by staggering addition of water by ~2 minutes).

**If you are planning to compare these samples with historical pH values, using a 0.1 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> solution in a 2:1 ratio can be used in addition to measuring pH using DI water.**

## **Calibration:**

1. Rinse probe with DI into waste beaker (dry probe, with kim wipe but do not touch bulb!).

2. Place probe in pH 7.00 buffer and press calibrate.  Wait until probe corrects the reading to 7.00.

3. Rinse and dry probe and place in pH 10 or 4 buffer (depending on the range you expect your soils to be in). Probe should automatically detect buffer and adjust.

4. After it stops flashing, press measure to view regression slope (should be within 95 to 105. Otherwise, redo STD curve or try new pH buffer solution).

5. Rinse probe and begin sample measurement.
