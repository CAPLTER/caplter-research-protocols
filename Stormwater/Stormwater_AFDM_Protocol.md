# **Stormwater Ash Free Dry Mass (AFDM) Protocol**

Revised October 2022


Note: use clean forceps and/or wear nitrile gloves to handle aluminum weight boats and filters. Use Whatman GF/F 47mm glass microfiber filters. Thaw samples the night before if frozen.


1. Set up filter apparatus and gather together your pre-ashed filters in their weigh boats. (Ash filters by placing them in a covered watch glass, then in a cold muffle furnace set at 500째C for 4 hours.  Store in the drying oven at 100째C for at least 30 minutes or until needed.  Remove to desiccator and allow to cool before weighing filters).  Note: make sure desiccant is fresh.  Spent desiccant can be recharged by baking in the drying oven at 100째C for 2 hours.

2. Weigh your filters and record.

   1. Place the filter and weigh boat on the scale.   
   2. Using forceps, lift the filter out of the weigh boat and tare the scale.   
   3. Place the filter back in the weigh boat and record the filter weight as well as the weigh boat ID on your datasheet next to the corresponding sample ID.   

3. Retrieve samples from cold room.

4. Place the filter on the filtering apparatus, and then shake the sample bottle vigorously to redistribute the particulates. Make sure the filter is centered, the cup is centered, and that you have used your clamps to secure the cup. Turn on the vacuum.

5. Measure sample in a graduated cylinder and pour sample into filtering apparatus. Allow vacuum to pull the entire sample through the filter. Record the total volume filtered on the datasheet. (If sample is very dirty and filtering very slowly, it is not necessary to filter the entire sample, just enough to see a clear change in weight once the sample is ashed.)

6. Turn off vacuum, remove filter to unique weigh boat, and place in the drying oven at 100 deg C. Allow to dry for 24 hours.

7. Remove boat and filter from drying oven and cool in desiccator. Tare the weigh boat while holding the filter with forceps. Reweigh filter and record (see step 2). The difference between the original weight and the new weight is the weight of the dry filter + residue before ignition.

8. Place filter and boat into a cold muffle furnace and set the temperature to 500째C. Allow ample to ash for 4 hours. The sample needs to ash for 3 hours, but you are adding an hour to allow the furnace to come to temperature.

9. Turn off furnace and let cool down. Carefully remove filters with boats from the furnace and place in the drying oven for at least 30 minutes, then place in the desiccator to cool. Reweigh (same as 2) and record the new weight. This is the weight of the filter + residue after ignition. Once this weight is recorded, the filter may be discarded.

10. Acid wash glassware and equipment. When dry, wrap glassware and equipment in aluminum foil and put away in cabinet.


## **Calculations:**

AFDM (mg/L) = **(wt of filter + residue before ignition (mg))** - **(wt of filter + residue after ignition (mg))** / (sample vol filtered (L))
