## **Overview:**

In Spring 2008 within each site, the CAP LTER randomly chose and permanently marked four 1m x 1m sub-plots within each 20m x 20m main plot, splot between two patch types, under *L. tridentata* shrubs and inter-plant spaces (hereafter, 'under *L. tridentata*, P' and 'Inter-plant space, IP'). At peak herbaceous biomass (in approximately March of each year), you will estimate percent cover of all annual herbaceous species rooted within these four plots (two each under *L. tridentata* and in interplant spaces, i.e., between shrubs). *Note that there are also four 1m x 1m "Biomass" sub-plots in each 20m x 20m plot - these are different than the community composition plots described here because they are clipped each year while the community composition plots are not. Care should be taken in the field to identify the correct four plots for community composition __and avoid the four plots to be harvested for biomass__*.


## **Supplies for field collection:**

* Clipboard and rubber bands/clips (to hold data sheets when windy)
* Data sheets
* Pencils, pens, sharpies
* 1 m<sup>2</sup> PVC quadrats
* Kneeling pads
* Species key, plant guides, and former flora lists for each site
* Coin envelopes (for unknowns)
* Site directions (in binder) and GPS unit
* Key for DBG gate padlock, keycode for EME and MCS gate padlocks
* Labeling tags, rebar, mallet (to replace rebar or tags for subplots at any site)
* Visual cut-outs of 1%, 5%, 10%, and 25% of 1m<sup>2</sup> (these can be helpful to visualize what x% cover in 1m<sup>2</sup> looks like)


## **Steps:**

1. On the top of the data sheet, record the date; names of the sampling crew (i.e. plant identifier, recorder); site (three letter code); plot number (1 to 75); treatment (Control [C1] - no sampling from C2 plots, Nitrogen [N], Phosphorus [P], and Nitrogen+Phosphorus [NP]); See Tables 1 and 2 below for plot numbers and site codes.

*Double check the plot numbers and sub-plot numbers!*

2. All plant identifiers (if more than one) should first calibrate their percent cover estimates on several test plots in the field prior to percent cover measurements. You want to make sure all botanists are seeing the plots similarly.

3. Place the 1m x 1m quadrat over the corner rebar at each 1m<sup>2</sup> plot. Working in teams of two (one recorder, one plant identifier), proceed through the steps below.

4. Estimate and record (at the bottom of the data sheet) the relative areal cover of herbaceous plant matter (i.e. green material) at the soil surface in the plot to the nearest percent (e.g., 70% green)< as if you were taking a "snapshot" of the plot. Do not include the base of any shrub (i.e., *Larrea*, *Ambrosia*, other) in this estimate, but do include any shrub seedlings. If there are soil crusts, measure those in a separate category, including any soil crusts under herbaceous cover. Also, separately record the percentage of dead or broken *Ambrosia* branches (or other litter) on the plot (if present).

5. Identify which annual species are present (rooted) in the plot and mark a small x in the corner of the data sheet to easily find later. Use roughly the same amount of effort in each plot to find plant species. As you get better, it will take less time because you are getting more skilled; as you get tired, it will take more time; in simpler systems, it will take less time. There is no *a priori* way to know when you are using the same amount of effort, but this is usually approximated by time (in minutes: typically 1-3 minutes per species). Each botanist should do some test plots to see how long it takes him/her to find "all" the species in the plot. Different botanists will take different amounts of time to apply the same effort - this is ok - but the same botanist should use approximately the same amount of time per plot.

6. Next, estimate and record the cover of each species individually to the nearest whole number (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3% ... 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%). If a species is present in a plot, but does not cover a full 1%, you may record it to the closest 0.1%. (Note that prior to 2016, if a species was present in a plot, but did not cover a full 1%, it was recorded as '<1%'.)  *The sum of all individual species cover can be greater than 100% since some species overlap.*  For both annuals and shrub cover estimates, use the Daubenmire method (imagine a line drawn about the leaf tips of the undisturbed canopies (ignoring inflorescence) and project these polygonal images on the ground).

7. For each shrub species (*Larrea*, *Ambrosia*, or other shrub or cactus), estimate and record the percent Cover and percent Base of the "overstory" shrubs rooted within the plots OR overhanging the plot, even if rooted outside the plot (no % Base in this case). Do not count dead shrubs in this estimate. Shrubs have two components: (1) Cover, the areal projection of the shrub onto a 2D grid, and (2) Base, the area of the stem base(s). Next, record percent Total Shrub Cover. If *Larrea* and *Ambrosia* (or other) shrub species overlap in their cover, aggregate these into a single percentage, recorded as % Total Shrub Cover (if no overlap, then % Total Shrub Cover will jsut be the sum of all shrub cover). For IP plots, this will be zero most of the time (unless there is a large shrub nearby that has grown over the plot). For P plots, this is the total cover of shrubs over the plot, excluding the base(s). It is expected that the cover of the shrubs will overlap the herbaceous species.

8. Unknown species are recorded with unique identifiers (e.g., 'Unknown 1', 'Unknown 2', etc.) along with a visual description of the plant and a picture to be used to help identify the unknown in the lab. When possible, a sample of the unknown species should collected from outside the plot (or inside the plot if not found outside) in a labeled coin envelope and brought to the herbarium to be identified. Unknown species are usually very small and/or undeveloped, and may not be able to be identified to species - this is ok. Err on the side of lumping unknown species into other known species in the same plot.

9. Use caution not to include the percent cover of desiccated/dead plants within the plots from the previous season (these can usually be identified easily as white, old plant material). However, depending on the timing of data collection, some herbaceous plants from the current growing season may have passed peak biomass and already begun to desiccate (dry out or senesce). In this case, estimate the percent cover of these plants as if they were at peak biomass.

10. **Before you leave a site, confirm that you have data sheets for all plots and sub-plots, and that there are no duplicates or ambiguous plot labels on your sheet.**
