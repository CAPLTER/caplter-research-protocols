**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** Soil Core Processing and Analysis

**Purpose**

This SOP covers the field procedures for processing and analyzing soil
cores in the lab.

**Potential Hazards**

Sharp tools and objects in the soil may present cutting hazards to
hands, arms, or skin.

**Materials**

- Plastic tray

- Aluminum foil

- Round aluminum tins

- Meter stick

- Sharp serrated knife

- Pen or sharp pencil

- “Whirl-Pak” plastic bags

**Procedures:**

1.  Prep your table or tray with a fresh sheet of foil and wear gloves.

2.  Remove core from the refrigerator and carefully take it out from the
    zip-lock bag (this is done much easier by cutting the zip-lock bag
    and sliding the core out).

3.  Pre-label aluminum tins with core location, section depth, and date.

4.  Weigh each tin and record as tin weight.

5.  Properly identify the “top” of the core before sectioning. The peaty
    material will make it obvious. Carefully section sediment cores at
    0-2 cm, 2-5 cm, 5+ cm. Use the serrated knife to gently cut the
    sections’ discs. Try to maintain the structure of the sediment core
    as much as possible.

    1.  Cut the 5+ cm section in two if necessary (ex: too large for one
        tin), and sub-labels to each 5+ cm section tin (

    2.  Example: First tin would be “M1E 11/17/2019 5+ cm (1/2)”, then
        “M1E 11/17/2019 5+ cm (2/2)”

6.  Place core sections in previously labeled aluminum tins and weigh
    using fine-scale balance. Record this as your initial sample+tin
    weight.

7.  Dry samples at 75 C until their weight remains constant. For some of
    these it may take 3-5 days.

**Bulk density**:

1.  Once samples have achieved stable dry weight, re-weigh and record
    dry sample+tin (this dry weight is known as bulk density).

**Further Preparation:**

1.  After recording bulk density, homogenize sample using mortar and
    pestle until consistent is fine powder.

2.  After homogenizing, sample will be split into approximately equal
    thirds

3.  First third: archive it by inserting it in a labeled whirl-pack, be
    sure to include “ARCHIVE” in the label.

**Organic content:**

1.  Weigh the second of the thirds in the original sample tin, then ash
    at 500 C for 4 hours and re-weigh to obtain organic content.
    Weighing before and after ashing can be done in the same tin. Make
    sure tin is tared (weighed empty) first.

**Nutrient analysis:**

1.  Place the last third in a labeled zip-lock bag (transfer all
    relevant sample metadata) and add the text “NUTRIENTS” on the label.

2.  Set aside until sample batch is done and ready to be analyzed for
    nutrients

3.  Follow SOP for soil nutrient analysis.
