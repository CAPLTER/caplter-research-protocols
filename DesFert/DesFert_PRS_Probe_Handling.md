# **PRS Probe Handling Instructions**

Please follow the information below to ensure that things go smoothly in regards to the PRS probes and that you get quality data. Here are a few pointers, in a more condensed format. These steps should be followed closely in order to obtain quality data from the PRS probes.

## **PRS Probe Storage:**

* __Keep in a cool, moist state during storage__ (refrigerate where possible, do not place in a freezer).

* __Do not let the membrane dry out__ (moisten with a small amount of DI, distilled, or RO water if needed).

* __Keep away from fertilizers or other concentrated chemicals__.

* __Do not expose to direct sunlight or extreme heat for extended periods__.

* __Do not touch the resin membrane portion of the probes with your bare hands__.


## **PRS Probe Use:**

Ensure complete soil to membrane contact when installing the PRS probes. This is critical since the nutrient supply rate calculation is based on the adsorbing surface area of the membrane.

1. If the soil is heavy, dry, hard, and/or rocky, preparing a slot prior to insertion is recommended to avoid breaking the PRS. In order to minimize PRS probe breakage, make a slot in the soil prior to inserting the PRS probe. You can use a metal file, knife, or some other implement about the same (or slightly smaller) width and thickness of the PRS probe to make the slot.

2. When you remove the PRS probes from the soil, knock off adhering soil, and then keep the probes cold until you can rinse the soil off the membrane. If you're doing continuous PRS probe burials, replace the "old" PRS probes with "fresh/new" ones at the time of PRS probe exchange.

3. After removal in the field, wash the PRS probes with DI water. This preliminary washing is recommended when samples will not be taken back to the lab for a couple of days. Completely wash the dirty PRS probes in the lab using DI or distilled water as soon as possible after removal. Both the PRS probe membrane and the plastic handle must be completely clean. Any trace of soil remaining on the PRS probe during elution can affect your data. Check the cracks and crevices of the plastic and where plastic meets membrane for soil and rinse it away.

4. After removing the probes from the soil and washing them, please combine the clean and wet anion and cation probes from each replicate plot (that are to be analyzed as one sample) into one clearly labeled self-selaing plastic bag (e.g. Ziploc) for analysis.

5. If you have retrieved PRS probes (sample) in your lab for a long period of time, please store them in the refrigerator or in a cool place until you are ready to ship them. Be sure to keep them moist (DI, RO or distilled water) if they are left in the refrigerator or in a cool, dark place. Do not let the resin membranes dry out. Please send the PRS probes back to Western AG Innovations as soon as you can.
