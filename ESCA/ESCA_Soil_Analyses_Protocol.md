# **ESCA (Survey200) Soil Analyses Protocols**

## **Soils:**

Bulk density soils (2-inch core) are used for determining soil pH and conductivity, and soil texture. Soils should be sieved and air-dried.

Soils from 1-inch cores are used as follows:

For determining available soil N, soil moisture content, and soil organic matter content soils should be sieved and fresh, not dried.

For determining soluble reactive (available) P soils should be sieved and air-dried.

For determining inorganic C, total C, and total N soils should be sieved, air-dried, and ball-milled.


## Determining available soil nitrogen (extractable NO<sub>3</sub>-N and NH<sub>4</sub>-N) content:

For sieved soil, weigh 10g fresh weight soil into 100mL bottles, add 50mL 2M KCl solution, and shake at low speed for 1 hour on reciprocating shaker. Let it settle for one hour, and filter soil slurry through Whatman no.42 125mm diameter ashless filter paper.

Weigh an additional 10g for soil moisture and organic matter content determination into a tared aluminum weighing pan and re-weigh. Record weight. Put pan + soil into 60 degree C oven for 48 hours. After 48 hours, remove pan + soil from oven and let cool 30 minutes in a desiccator. Then weigh again. Record dry weight. Then place pan + soil into 550 degree C muffle furnace for 2 hours. Use the one in GWC677. After 2 hours, shut off furnace and open the door a crack, and leave soil to cool until the following day. Remove pan + soil from furnace and place in 60 degree C oven for 48 hours. After 48 hours, remove pan + soil from oven and let cool 30 minutes in a desiccator. Re-weight and record weight. These data will be used to calculate moisture and organic matter content.

Analyze KCl soil extracts on the Lachat flow onjection analyzer in GWC677 and determine NH<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>3</sub> concentrations in mg N/L.

Samples that are not analyzed within a day of extraction should be kept frozen.


Preparation of chemical solutions:

2M KCl: weigh 150g KCl, dissolve in 750mL nanopure water, bring the water level to 1L level. Or dissolve 600g KCl in 3L water and bring the final water level to 4L mark. Prepare all standards using the same extraction solution (2M KCl).


## **Calculations:**

Soil % Moisture Content (calculated as g H<sub>2</sub>O held by 100g DW soil) = (Fresh soil weight - Dry soil weight)/Dry soil weight x 100%.

% Soil organic matter = (Soil DW before ashing - DW after ashing) / Soil DW before ashing x 100%.

Dry Soil/Fresh Soil Ratio = Dry soil weight / Fresh soil weight (This is the soil moisture correction factor - see Procedure 'F' below).

Dry soil weight used for KCl extraction = Fresh soil weight used for KCl extraction x Dry/Fresh ratio (soil moistrue correction factor)

Soil Extractable N (mg N/kg DW soil) = N concentrations in KCl solution (mg/L) x 50 (volume of KCl used for extraction) / Soil Dry weight used for extraction.


## **Extraction:**

Calculate the volume of the bicarbonate extractant needed for the number of samples to be analyzed (40mL per sample if using 2g soil).

Prepare 0.5M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extractant. For 1L, use 42 grams reagent grade NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The solution pH should be approximately 8.5. Adjust by adding NaOH pellets first, then 15N NaOH (600g NaOH pellets/1L nanopure), or 50% w/w NaPH solution by dropper when close.

Air dry soil and sieve to remove rocks and other large particles. Survey200 soils have already been sieved so more sieving should not be necessary. If pre-dried soil in bags appears moist, leave bags open overnight to dry. If soils appear to have not been sieved prior to air drying (consist mainly of large dried chunks), grind a subsample with small mortar and pestle and use this for the analysis.

Acid wash sample vials & filter funnels before use.

Weigh about 2g of air dried and sieved soil into 100mL bottles, add 40mL of the 0.5M bicarbonate solution and shake at low speed for 1 hour on reciprocating shaker. RECORD EXACT WEIGHT of soil used for each sample.

Filter samples through Whatman no. 42 ashless filter paper (using ordinary unashed filters may add P to the filtrate). Fold the filters into quarters & place in folter funnels. Ensure filter papers and funnels are rinsed with the extractant solution BEFORE filtration. Filter the sample and retain the filtrate in a clean vial. At this point the samples can be FROZEN if not going to be analyzed right away (samples should be analyzed within 48 hours of production OR frozen for later analysis). Dump the dirty filter paper.

Once filtrate is ready to analyze, pour into Lachat sample tubes and pH adjust the filtrate with conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to a pH of 5-6, otherwise proper color development may not occur in the later stages of the analysis. Analyze on the Lachat flow injection analyzer in GWC677 and deterine available P concentrations in mg P/L. Calculate soil P in mg/kg (ppm) by multiplying the solution concentration in mg/L times 20.


## Inorganic carbon analysis using modified pressure-calcimeter:

Reagent: 6M HCl with 3% by weight FeCl2.4H2O  

To a 1L volumetric flask, add 30g FeCl2.4H2O + 500mL conc HCl. Allow to cool. Dilute to mark and mix.


## **Procedure:**

Weigh 1g of sample or standard into serum bottle, either 20mL or 100mL, depending on sensitivity desired. Sherrod et al (2002) suggest screening samples by using a 1 hour reaction time with a 0.25g sample size in the 100mL bottle, and then evaluating the voltage produced. This is fine as long as there is enough sample. As long as your samples are less than 1.8% IC, it is probably safe to use the 20mL bottle. With higher concentrations you risk cracking and possibly shattering the bottle.

Carefully add vial containing 2mL of 6M HCl reagent to serum bottle with tweezers. Periodically rinse tweezers to keep from corroding. Wear gloves, glasses, and lab coat.

Place septum on bottle top, then aluminum seal. Seal with crimpers. Take care not to spill acid.

Agitate bottle to knock over vial so that acid comes in contact with sample. Ensure that acid and sample are well-mixed. Allow bottle to sit overnight.

Measure voltage of sample as follows:

Turn on power supply to pressure transducer.

Turn on multimeter. Press range button until you are in volts. Press max/min button. Display should indicate max. In this mode the maximum voltage reading is displayed.

Remove tear-out portion of bottle seal and pierce with needle hooked up to pressure transducer. Record voltage displayed on multimeter. Turn off meter between sample measurements to clear out the old reading.


## **Notes:**

One standard curve should be run with each batch of samples. Use the appropriate standard range for the sensitivity desired:

20mL bottle: 0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 % IC std

100mL bottle: 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 6.0 % std

The method detection limit (MDL) for the 20mL bottle of 0.017% inorganic C. FOr the 100mL bottle the MDL is 0.042% inorganic C. For samples with inorganic C content of less than 1%, use the 20mL bottle. For 1% of greater, use the 100mL bottle.

Rinse bottles and vials in tap water, acid wash prior to use.

Important: Replace syringe needle after every sample run. Acid fumes cause buildup of corrosion insode the needle, which restricts flow and reduces sensitivity.

# **Soil pH and Conductivity Protocol:**

Note: use Survey200 bulk density soils for this analysis

**First calibrate the Accumet pH meter:**

* In pH mode, press setup, which shows percent slope of last calibration.

* Press setup again to access the clear buffers option.

* Press enter to clear the buffers used in the previous calibration.

* Immerse rinsed electrode in pH 7 buffer, press std, then press std again to start calibration. When the buffer has been accepted, repeat with the pH 10 buffer.

* If the percent slope is outside the range of 90-102, the meter will display 'electrode error' and will not return to the Measure screen until you press enter. Repeat calibration process until slope is in range.

* When calibration is successful, the meter will return to the Measure screen. To measure pH, place rinsed electrode in soil sample and press enter.


**pH measurement:**

* Calibrate the electrode at the start of each day. Use pH 7 and 10 buffers (unless soil pH expected to be <7, in which case use 4 & 7 buffers).

* Take soil bag & invert several times to ensure sample well-mixed. Scoop soil from the center of the bag (not off the top).

* Weigh 20g (+/- 0.1g) of soil into a small beaker. Add 20mL of nanopure water.

* Batches of 15-30 samples should be weighed & mixed together to maximize efficient use of lab time.

* Mix soil-water well using a glass rod. Try & break up any clods. Set timer & leave to sit for 20 mins. Stir again. Leave for 10 minutes more.

* Rinse electrode with nanopure water, gently blot dry with a Kimwipe, set in sample & stir **GENTLY (DO NOT GRIND ELECTRODE INTO SEDIMENT AT BOTTOM OF CUP)**.  Allow electrode to rest near bottom of sample until reading is stable.

* Record pH on datasheet, rinse electrode, and repeat with next sample.

* At the end of the day, close the top ring on the electrode (twist to right) and place in the storage solution.


**Conductivity Measurement:**

* Calibrate the electrode with 1413 &mu;Seimens solution.

* Stir sample in beaker until homogenized.

* Insert the electrode into the soil slurry and stir gently, then let sit and wait for conductivity measurement to equilibrate.

* Rinse the electrode with deionized water. Make sure all sediment has been removed.


**Moisture Content:**

* Weigh an aluminum oven pan; record weight.

* Add 10-20 grams of soil to pan and place in 60 degree C oven for at least 40 hours.

* Remove pans from oven and place in dessicator until cool. Record weight.

* Place pans in 105 degree oven for at least 24 hours.

* Place pans in dessicator until cool and record weight.


Notes:

Careful storage of the pH electrode is essential. Store overnight in pH 7 buffer in a beaker covered with parafilm. For weekend storage and longer use the electrode cap, filled with pH 7 for short periods (few days) or in pH 4 buffer (Electrode Storage Solution) for longer periods.

If necessary, refill the electrode with the special solution and open the top ring on the electrode barrel (twist to left).


# **Determining Soil Texture (Particle Size) - use bulk density soils for this analysis:**

This method is taken from: Gee, G.W., and J.W. Bauder 1986. Particle size analysis. p. 383-411. *In*: A. Klute (ed.) Methods of soil analysis, part 1. Physical and Mineralogical Methods. 2nd ed. Agron. Monogr. 9 ASA and SSSA, Madison, WI. (2nd edition).

The method here wil separate the sand, silt, and clay fractions. Additional hydrometer readings can be taken if greater discrimination within the size fractions is desired (see Gee and Bauder 1986).

## **Equipment and Reagents:**

* Hydrometer, ASTM no. 152 H with Bouyoucos scale in g L<sup>-1</sup>

* Large reciprocal shaker

* Metal dispersing cups (for milk shake machines)

* 500mL Nalgene bottles

* Plunger for sedimentation cylinders, if available (A long rod with a perforated disk attached to the bottom)

* Sedimentation cylinders with 1L mark

* Amyl alcohol (only if there is excess foam after shaking)

* Sodium metaphosphate solution, 50g/L

* Scale accurate to 0.1g

* Distilled water

* Thermometer

* Parafilm


## **Soil Dispersion:**

Weigh a sample for analysis into a 500mL Nalgene bottle. If the soil is fine textured, silty or clayey, use about 50g. If the soil is coarse textured, use about 75g.

Weigh about 10g into a small weighing pan to determine a soil moisture correction factor. Place in oven and dry at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. (This step has been completed for the entire 200-point survey.)

Add 250mL of distilled water and 100mL of sodium metaphosphate solution to the sample in the Nalgene bottle. Place bottles in the reciprocal shaker and turn on 'low' setting for 24 hours.

Quantitatively transfer the suspension to a 1000mL settling cylinder and bring the volume to 1000mL.


## **Hydrometer measurements:**

Allow time for mixture to equilibrate thermally (10 min is sufficient) and record temperature.

Insert the plunger and while holding the bottom of the cylinder, mix the solution thoroughly. Stirring should be dhone with rapid upstrokes and gentle downstrokes such that all the sediments are dislodged from the bottom of the cylinder. Mix in this fashion for about 5 to 10 seconds, finish with two or three slow smooth strokes. If a plunger is not available, cover the top of the cylinder with parafilm, and then the palm of your hand, and grasping the bottom of the cylinder, carefully invert the cylinder and in an up-and-down motion, thoroughly mix the contents. Do not allow the contents of the cylinder to leak or spill.

When mixing is completed, insert the hydrometer slowly into the solution and take a reading (at the *top* of the meniscus) at 0.5 min and 1 min. Begin timing as soon as the cylinder is placed on the table after mixing. Record as R<sub>0.5</sub> and R<sub>1</sub>. Read to the nearest 0.5g. Rinse and dry the hydrometer between samples. Record temperature after the R<sub>1</sub> reading.

Take a hydrometer reading at 90 min and 1440 min (24 hr). Record as R<sub>90</sub> and R<sub>1440</sub>. Record the temperature at the time of each reading.

Prepare a blank solution (100mL HMP, 900mL distilled water, no soil) and read and record the temperature at the same times as the soil solution above. Record as R<sub>L 0.5</sub>, R<sub>L1</sub>, R<sub>L90</sub>, and R<sub>L1440</sub>.


## **Calculations:**

### Clay Fraction:

Use the 90 min and 1440 min readings (both R and R<sub>L</sub> values).

Compute the mean particle size diameter in suspension (X) and the summation percentage (P) for the 90 and 1440 min readings. Use the equations below:

**X = &theta;t<sup>-1/2</sup>**

Where *t* is time and &theta; is the sedimentation parameter and is a function of hydrometer settling depth, solution viscosity, particle density and solution density.

The sedimentation parameter &theta; can be determined as follows:

**&theta; = (18&eta;h'/[g(&rho;_s_ - &rho;_l_)])<sup>1/2</sup>**

Where:

* &eta; = solution viscosity is poise, g cm<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (viscosity of H<sub>2</sub>O at deg C 1.02125, which can be obtained from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics)

* h' = effective hydrometer depth, cm (-0.164R+16.3) R is the uncorrected hydrometer reading. This assumes ASTM 152H hydrometer and standard sedimentation cylinder.

* g = gravitational constant, cm s<sup>-2</sup> (980 cm s<sup>-2</sup>)

* &rho;_s_ = soil particle density, g cm<sup>-3</sup> (2.65 g cm<sup>-3</sup>)

* &rho;_l_ = solution density, g cm<sup>-3</sup> (density of H<sub>2</sub>O at deg C 1.00315, which can be obtained from the Handbook of Chemistry and Physics)


The summation percentage for a given time interval can be determined as follows:

__P = (C/C<sub>0</sub>)*100__

Where:

* C = concentration of soil in suspension in g L<sup>-1</sup>. (determined C = R - R<sub>L</sub>)

* R = hydrometer reading of sample

* R<sub>L</sub> = hydrometer reading in blank

(R and R<sub>L</sub> taken at each time interval)

C<sub>O</sub> = oven dry weight of the sample


Compute the summation percentage at 2*u*m. This is determined from the equation below: (This is the percent clay)

**P<sub>2um</sub> = _m_ ln (2/X<sub>1440</sub> + P<sub>1440</sub>)**

Where:

* _m_ = (P<sub>90</sub> - P<sub>1440</sub>)/ln(X<sub>90</sub>/X<sub>1440</sub>)

* X<sub>1440</sub> = mean particle diameter in suspension at 1440 min

* P<sub>1440</sub> = summation percentage at 1440 min

* X<sub>90</sub> = mean particle diameter in suspension at 90 min

* P<sub>90</sub> = summation percentage at 90 min


### Sand Fraction:

Compute the 50 _u_m summation percentage using the same procedure as above, but using 0.5 and 1 min hydrometer readings. The equation for summation percentage at 50 _u_m differs as follows:

**P<sub>50um</sub> = _m_ ln (50/X<sub>1</sub> + P<sub>1</sub>)**


### Silt Fraction:

Determine the silt fraction by subtraction as follows:

**% silt = 100 - (% sand + % clay)**


### Comments:

Assuming weighing of the samples is accurate, two sources of error exist:

1. Flocculation of clays by soluble salts or gypsum during sedimentation. This can be dealt with in two ways. 

   1. Increasing the concentration of HMP to levels high enough to maintain dispersion (be sure to use same solution in blank)
   2. treatment with an acid most commonly 1M HCl, adding enough so the sample is acidified to pH 3.5 to 4.0. I would recommend increasing the concentration of HMP first since this is less troublesome than working with HCl.

2. Hydrometer reading can be a major source of error. Studies have shown that a 1% error in reading will result in a 2% error in clay calculations. (Read at the top of the meniscus since capillary action wicks the H<sub>2</sub>O up the hydrometer stem.)


## Determining the Soil Moisture Correction Factor:

Typically, air dry soil is used for analysis as oven drying can change the nutrient conent of a soil by volatilizing nutrients, or causing changes in shape of clay humus particles. Results of soil analyses are expressed on an oven dry basis as soil moisture changes with time. When analysis is performed on a soil that will have results expressed a dry weight, a soil moisture correction factor (smcf) must be calculated on a subsample.

### Procedure:

The weight of the sample should be about 10 grams and should be taken at the time you weigh the samples intended for analysis. The smcf should be taken from the bulk sample in such a way as to be representative of the bulk sample. This means avoid the edges of the container or stray chunks of soil which are of a differing moisture content than the bulk sample. Samples are usually dried for 24 hours at 105 deg C. After removal of the smcf sample from the drying oven, place in a desiccator for about 30 to 60 minutes. This will prevent the sample from adsorbing moisture from the air as it cools.

The smcf is calculated as follows:

**smcf = (dry weight/moist weight)**

Where dry weight is the oven dry weight of the soil dried for 24 hours at 105 deg C.

To convert the moist soil weight in your lab analysis to dry weight:

**Dry Weight = (Moist weight)(smcf)**

The formula for smcf is a modification of the formula for percent dry matter.
