# **Micromet Towers Rain Gauge Calibration**

Texas Electronics TR-525USW


**Items needed:**

* Graduated cylinder with pre-drilled draining hole

* Black anodized calibration funnel

* #65 (brass) and #70 (aluminum) nozzles

* Cleaning pins for each nozzle


Step 1: Remove gold anodized collector from the sensor and replace it with the black calibration funnel and desired nozzle. Nozzle screws onto the tip of the funnel. Calibration funnel should be clean to prevent nozzle clogging.

Step 2: Zero counter, logger, or recording device. You can use a digital lab timer and mark counts as they occur on paper.

Step 3: Water measurement - while holding your thumb over the drain hole, hill graduated cylinder with water above the hole.

Step 4: Accurate water measure - while holding drain hole closed, place graduated cylinder on a level surface. Remove thumb and allow excess water to drain. This gives you the precise amount of water needed for calibration.

Step 5: Filling calibration funnel - replace thumb over drain hole and pour the water from the graudated cylinder into the funnel. Do not splash as this will affect results. Calibration begins immediately, so start timer as you start pouring. Once all the water has passed through the funnel, see below:


**Calibration Results**

Brass Nozzle (#65): Calibration should take 25 minutes and you should have 56 &plusmn; 2 counts.

Aluminum Nozzle (#70): Calibration should take 45 minutes and you should have 58 &plusmn; 2 counts.

If the rain gauge does not fall within acceptable calibration ranges, repeat the calibration procedure at lease once to eliminate the possibility of technical error. It after repeating the gauge is still out of calibration, use the following procedure for adjustment:

Step 1: Locate adjustment screws - turn gauge upside down to locate the 2 adjusting screws. When adjusting calibration, both screws must be turned the same amount to keep the tipping bucket balanced.

Step 2: Adjust calibration screws - to increase counts turn screws clockwise. To decrease counts turn screws counter-clockwise. Generally, a 1/4 turn of both screws represents approximately 1 count.

Step 3: Repeat calibration procedure to insure proper adjustment.
