**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios

**Procedure:** Water Quality field sampling

**Purpose**

This SOP provides information on how to take water quality samples taken
as part of regular bi-monthly sampling at the Tres Rios Wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

- Loose or muddy soils, insect bites or stings, uneven terrain, and
  extreme summer temperatures, water.

**Materials**

- 1L acid-washed Nalgene Bottles (13)

- YSI 2030 Pro DO field probe

- YSI ph100 pH meter

- Tote bags (2)

- Waders

**Preparation (before heading to the field)**

1.  Pack 12 clean acid-washed 1L Nalgene bottles in a cooler along with
    a handful of frozen freezer/cooler packs to ensure samples remain
    cool.

2.  Fill the 13<sup>th</sup> bottle with DI water for rinsing probes and
    equipment.

3.  Calibrate both the pH and DO field probes. Replace batteries if
    necessary.

**Collecting samples**

1.  Samples and measurements are to be collected at 5 locations:
    whole-system inflow, whole-system outflow, and then the transects
    M1E, M4S, and M4N.

2.  *Whole system:*

    1.  Take triplicate (3) 1L water samples from the inflow/outflow.
        Rinse and empty each bottle twice before filling completely on
        the third time. Be sure all sample water that is dumped is done
        so away from the sampling point to avoid contamination.

    2.  Use the pH and DO probes to record: water temperature, pH,
        conductance, specific conductance, DO %, and DO mg/L.

        1.  Be sure DO probe is fully submerged, and shake gentle to
            release any trapped air bubbles.

    3.  Rinse probe tips with DI water.

    4.  Place collected samples in the cooler for refrigeration until
        processing.

3.  *Transects:*

    1.  Take triplicate (3) 1L water samples from the shore and open
        water ends of each of the three transects (M1E, M4S, M4N). Rinse
        and empty each bottle twice before filling completely on the
        third time. Be sure all sample water that is dumped is done so
        away from the sampling point to avoid contamination.

    2.  Use the pH and DO probes to record: water temperature, pH,
        conductance, specific conductance, DO %, and DO mg/L.

        1.  Be sure DO probe is fully submerged, and shake gentle to
            release any trapped air bubbles.

    3.  Rinse probe tips with DI water.

    4.  Place collected samples in the cooler for refrigeration until
        processing.

    5.  Only collect samples if water is present across the entire
        transect. For example, do not collect open water samples if it
        cannot be compared to shore water samples.
