# **ADP Sample Collection Protocol**

Updated July 2020

One collector is currently operating on the roof of LSA. A key is located in GWC 681 in the desk drawer and is labeled "LSA Roof" with white lab tape.

### **Supplies:**

* Buckets (weighed, bagged, and labeled)
* Lids (weighed, bagged, and labeled)
* Backpack with ADP field datasheets and instructions, cleaning cloths/sponges, sandpaper, wire brush and/or water bottle, screwdriver, mineral oil, and Vaseline

### **Field Procedure/Sampling Schedule:**

Dry buckets are changed monthly, all on the same day (the third Tuesday of each month).

Wet buckets are collected/changed according to the following rules:

* Collect a sample after EVERY rainfall event.
* If a series of storms is expected over a period of days, wait until the storms are over to collect.

Once collected, the buckets should be prepped right away. If this is not possible, then the buckets may be placed in the cold room in GWC 675 to wait for prepping.

Be careful not to contaminate the old or new bucket. If the sample is spilled or the bucket is dropped at any time, especially if the rim of the bucket or lid contacts any surfaces, make a note.

### **Changing the wet side bucket:**

To ensure the collector is working properly, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or the wire brush and watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. The lid seal pad should rest snugly on the dry side bucket. See the troubleshooting section below if there is a problem.

Examine the wet side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the field datasheet.

Using the garbage bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the wet side bucket.

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.

On the datasheet, record initials, time, date, amount of rain in the rain gauge, lid label and weight, old bucket label and weight, new bucket label, and contaminants.

After recording the amount of rain, empty the contents of the rain gauge.

While the roof is still covering the dry side bucket, wipe the top of the roof, sensor, and around the buckets to remove bird droppings, dirt, etc. that could contaminate the sample bucket.

Using the garbage bag as a glove, place the new wet side bucket in the bucket holder.

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, if necessary, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.

Place the securely closed bucket into the garbage bag the clean bucket was in.


### **Changing the dry side bucket:**

Examine the dry side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the field datasheet.

Using the garbage bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the dry side bucket.

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.

On the datasheet, record initials, time, date, lid label, old bucket label, new bucket label, and contaminants.

Inspect the battery in its housing and check the voltage with a volt meter and record on the datasheet. The voltage should be above 13V. If not, it may be time to replace the battery with a new one.

To ensure the collector is working properly, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or the wire brush and watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. See the troubleshooting section below if there is a problem.

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.

Before replacing the dry bucket and with the roof covering the wet side bucket, wipe the top of the roof, sensor, and around the buckets to remove bird droppings, dirt, etc. that could contaminate the sample bucket.

Using the garbage bag as a glove, place the new dry side bucket in the bucket holder.

Place the securely closed bucket into the garbage bag the clean bucket was in.


### **Changing both buckets:**

To ensure the collector is working properly, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or the wire brush and watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. The lid seal pad should rest snugly on the dry side bucket. See the troubleshooting section below if there is a problem.

Examine the wet side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the datasheet.

Using the garbage bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the wet side bucket.

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.

On the field datasheet, record initials, time, date, amount of rain in rain gauge, lid label and weight, old wet bucket label and weight, new wet bucket label, and contaminants.

After recording the amount of rain, empty the contents of the rain gauge.

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.

Examine the dry side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Record signs of contamination on the datasheet.

Using the garbage bag the lid is in as a glove, place the lid on the dry side bucket.

Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly.

On the field datasheet, record the lid label, old dry bucket label, new dry bucket label, and contaminants.

Now that both buckets have been removed, wipe the top of the roof, sensor, and around the buckets to remove bird droppings, dirt, etc. that could contaminate the sample buckets.

Using the garbage bag as a glove, place the new dry side bucket in the bucket holder.

Again, short out the sensor with a few drops of water or wire brush, and then using the garbage bag as a glove, place the new wet side bucket in the bucket holder.

Blow off any excess water on the sensor, waiting until the roof moves back to the wet side.

Place the securely closed buckets into the garbage bags the clean buckets were in.

If the sensor, motor, or battery is not working and the roof has stuck allowing water in the dry or both sides, pour all samples into the dry bucket, record on the field datasheet that this is a "bulk" sample (i.e., wet and dry composition combined), and then put the collector in "bulk" sample mode (wet bucket is exposed). If the collector motor box will not move the lid, reach under the main frame of the collector and push the clutch arm counter-clockwise. The clutch will disengage and the lid mechanism will be free of the drive system. Manually position the lid over the dry side bucket and use the bucket retaining springs to secure the lid. Disconnect the collector from the power supply.


### **Troubleshooting Tips for ADP Collector:**

If the collector fails to operate, try the following:

* Check the power source.
* Battery: Check for corrosion of the battery cable connections at the battery and at the motor. Many times the connectors at the battery become corroded, resulting in a bad connection. Sanding the connectors clean will solve this problem. Check the battery voltage; the battery may be dead. If the connectors at the motor are the problem, sand clean, apply Vaseline and reconnect.
* Check the wet sensor. Replace with a spare and see if the collector operates. If not, then the motor is bad and must be replaced. A faulty motor box is usually indicated by one of four things:
   * Upon a "wet" sense, the roof cycles continuously back and forth.
   * Upon a "dry" sense, the roof cycles continuously back and forth.
   * The motor does not run at all, even when the crank arm is placed in a vertical position by hand.
   * The temperature of the sensor plate is HOT when the collector is in the "dry" collection state.

All of these conditions indicate that one of the mercury wetted switches within the motor is faulty. Unfortunately, Aerochem Metrics, the company that manufactured the ADP collectors, no longer exists and collectors of this type are no longer made. The only remedy is to remove the motor, which comes off as a unit, and replace it with a spare. If no spares are available, then it may be necessary to purchase the new-type collector manufactured by N-CON Systems [here](http://www.n-con.com/Products/ads.html).
