# **DesFert (CN DEP) Soil Collection Protocol for Site Selection**


At this point we are trying to screen sites to make sure that none have anomalously high C, N, or P. On the other hand, if the sites look (after this initial screening) good then we can use left-over soils for this collection for some preliminary lab experiments. To determine whether soil carbon and nutrients are anomalously high, it would be nice to have some baseline data for comparison. The 200 point survey is an obvious choice, but that would require coring to 10 cm which is a lot of work. So, I think we should sample to 2 cm which would make our data comparable to recent measurements at Sycamore Creek (we should check with Jill/Ryan to make sure this depth is correct).

We discussed the following analyses:


**At ASU:**

1. Mass of course (>2mm) and fine (<2mm) fractions (sieving)
2. Soil texture (sand, silt, clay) of fine fraction (hydrometer - 40g)
3. Extractable inorganic P (sodium bicarbonate extraction - 10g)
4. Inorganic C (pressure calcimeter - 1g ground)
5. Organic matter (muffle furnace)


**At CC:**

1. KCl extractable ammonium and nitrate pools (10g)
2. Gravimetric soil moisture (10g)
3. Net N mineralization and nitrification (10g)
4. Total soil C and N (dry combustion - 1g ground)


**Here is the protocol for field collection:**

1. At each site, pick 5 creosote, 5 ambrosia, and 5 open spaces to sample (one sample from each plot).
2. At each creosote bush, choose a random direction (0 to 360 degrees), then measure halfway between the center of the bush and the edge of the crown along the random radius. This will be the soil sampling location.
3. At the sampling location, remove any loose surface organic matter (loose leaves, twigs, etc.)
4. Use a 10cm x 10cm quadrat (or something similar in size) and collect all soil within the quadrat to a depth of 2cm. Take care to saple the entire area to the same depth (unless you hit a rock).
5. We will need ~100g soil (excluding rocks), so if you don't have enouth soil after one sampling, then collect another location from under the same bush and make a note that the ziplock bag includes soil from two quadrats.
6. Do Steps 2 through 5 at each ambrosia bush.
7. For open spaces, guesstimate the geographic center of the open space and repeat Steps 2 through 5.
8. If the soils are moist or wet, place them in a cooler with blue ice packs in the car  during transport. Take care to ensure that the blue ice doesn't sit directly on the soil samples to prevent freezing at the point of contact (put a piece of cardboard or something between the blue ice packs and the soil samples). Make sure that these moist soils stay cool. If soils in the field are dry (and have been dry for >2 weeks), then place them in a cooler but without any blue ice packs. Even though they are dry, it will be important to keep the temperature to a reasonable level (i.e. don't keep them in a locked car for too long).


**Back in the lab (or soil processing room - roof of LSA building):**

1. Sieve all samples at 2mm and weigh both fractions. If soil is wet, take care to not let the soil dry out too much during sieving. In this case, sieve quickly and place the soil back in the ziplock bag.
2. Make a mass-based composite sample of the <2mm fraction from each site and microsite (i.e. creosote, ambrosia, or open space) using at least 20g of soil from each bag. In the end, you should have 3 composites from each site (one from each microsite of creosote, ambrosia, and open spaces).


**Sending the soils to CC:**

1. If soils are moist or wet, place the soil samples in a cooler with at least 4 large frozen blue ice packs. As before, take care to ensure that the blue ice doesn't sit directly on the soil samples to prevent freezing at the point of contact (put a piece of cardboard or something between the blue ice packs and the soil samples. If soils are dry (and have been dry for >2 weeks), then place them in a cooler without any blue ice packs (but keep the soils at a reasonable temperature).
2. Send soils overnight in a cooler to:
