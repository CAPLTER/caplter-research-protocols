**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios

**Procedure:** Water Quality sample processing

**Purpose**

This SOP provides information on how to handle and process water quality
samples taken as part of regular bi-monthly sampling at the Tres Rios
Wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

- Exposure to field samples

- Corrosive substances

**Required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

- Nitrile-free gloves

- Eye protection

- Lab coat

**Materials**

- Erlenmeyer flask (1)

- Filter stopper (1)

- Filter clamp (1)

- Sample receptacle (pre-filter) (1)

- 47 mm GF/F grade glass microfiber filters (pre-ashed, at least 14
  filters)

- Vacuum source and vacuum line (1)

- Field H2O samples (12)

- 45ml Falcon centrifuge tubes (36)

- Ammonium tubes (12)

- DOC vials (12)

**Procedures – preparing and filtering (WEEL Lab Facilities, LSA205)**

1.  Print, label, and arrange your data sheet.

2.  Label and arrange all vials and tubes before beginning water
    processing (see Appendix A for details).

3.  Assemble your filtering apparatus using the Erlenmeyer flask, filter
    stopper, filter clamp, and sample receptacle (see Appendix A for
    details).

4.  Power on the vacuum line – switches are located at the north-west
    corner of the western lab bench in LSA205.

5.  Remove first sample from cooler – note the corresponding vials and
    falcon tubes.

6.  Place a pre-ashed Whatman 47mm GF/F filter in the filtering
    apparatus and rinse filter with a small amount of sample. Swirl
    filtrate around the Eralmire flask and discard. Filter approximately
    300 mL of the remaining sample.

    1.  Note: When filtering the sample the amount of sediment in the
        sample will dictate the amount of sample you will be able to
        push through the filter. If samples look heavy with sediment
        pour small amount of sample though the filter and change filter
        when it becomes clogged and replace with unused pre-ashed
        Whatman 47mm.

7.  While sample is filtering, agitate the unfiltered sample and use it
    to rinse and fill the TN & TP (~40mL) and ammonium tubes (~4/5
    full).

8.  Once done processing, use a small amount of filtrate to rinse Falcon
    tubes for Cation and Anions and the DOC vial. Empty rinsing solution
    and fill to approximately 40mL.

9.  Arrange completed Falcon and ammonium tubes to ensure good
    organization throughout the remainder of the work.

10. Disassemble filtering apparatus, discard used filter(s), and
    thoroughly rinse all components of filtering apparatus with
    deionized (DI) water. Reassemble filtering apparatus with a fresh
    filter.

11. Repeat steps 4-9 until all samples have been processed.

12. Prepare all samples for transport and drop-off.

**Procedures – final preparation and drop-off (GEL Lab Facilities)**

1.  Access the Goldwater Environmental Lab (GEL) in GWC681.

2.  Place TN, TP, Anion, and ammonium samples in an empty space in the
    freezer in the back room.

    1.  CLEARLY label sample trays and bags with permanent marker (and
        label tape if necessary) to ensure proper processing and data
        output (see Appendix B for details)

3.  Both DOC and Cation samples will need to be acidified. In both
    cases, make use of the fume hood, along with appropriate PPE. Acids
    will be found in the fume hood in GWC681.

    1.  To acidify DOC samples, use a pipette to carefully deliver 2
        drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to each sample.

    2.  To acidify Cation samples, use a balance to weigh each sample.
        Multiply the weight of each sample by 7.144, round to the
        nearest whole number, and write this amount in permanent marker
        on the cap of each tube. This is the amount, in microliters, of
        concentrated nitric acid to add to each sample. Use a calibrated
        pipette to deliver this amount of nitric acid to each sample.

        1.  Be sure to tare the balance first using an empty falcon
            tube.

        2.  When adding nitric acid, start with the smallest number and
            work your way up. Easier to add more acid if you forget to
            change the pipette, rather than the other way around.

4.  Ensure both DOC and Cation samples have been labeled with “Acidified
    with (acid) by (your initials)”

5.  Leave DOC vials on the lab bench, and Cation samples will be
    returned to LSA205 lab for archive.
