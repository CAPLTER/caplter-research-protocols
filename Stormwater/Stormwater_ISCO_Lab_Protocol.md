# **Stormwater ISCO Lab Protocol**

Updated July 2009



## **Sampling Equipment Location:**

* ISCO 6700 - GWC681

* 12 volt battery - GWC681 chemical hood

* Replacement 500mL bottles and carousel - GWC681

* Spare tubing and parts for ISCO - GWC681

* Protocol

* Key for ISCO housing @ IBW - Toyota Tacoma


## **Prior to sampling:**

* Ash 47mm GF/F filters in numbered aluminum pans at 500 deg for 4 hours

* Let cool and place in drying oven at 60 deg C for 30 minutes

* After 30 minutes, place in desiccator until cool

* When cool, weigh the filters in the Aluminum weigh pan but be sure to tare pan so only the weight of the filter is recorded

* Acid wash all ISCO bottles and place in carousel

* Charge 12 volt battery

* Check ISCO for any signs of damage or dirt

* Print field sheets out


## **Field Equipment Checklist:**

* Field data sheets

* Key for ISCO housing

* Clean bottles for autosampler (24 sample bottles + 1 bottle placed in the middle of carousel for the blank)

* Put all caps inside a foil-lined plastic quart-sized Ziploc bag

* ASU ID

* Lab tape to label bottles

* Pencils and sharpie

* 12 volt battery


## **ISCO sample retrieval and bottle replacement:**

* Upon arrival to Indian Bend Wash, note conditions of the wash (water level, flow...)

* If wash is still flowing, cap and switch out filled bottles with new capped bottles. Note the time.

* Note: If wash stops flowing before program ends, unused bottles will need to be cleaned.


## **Before leaving site, make sure that:**

* ISCO housing is locked

* Datasheet is filled out as best as possible

* All samples are identified (using tape and sharpie) and tightly capped

* Return to lab, place in cold room if not able to process right away


## **Processing Samples in Laboratory:**

* Labeling falcon and ammonium tubes using the two-digit day and four-digit time: July 1 at 2:35pm = 010235

* Agitate first ISCO sample and pour into ammonium tube

* Centrifuge sample in ammonium tubes @ 8000rpm for 10 minutes. When finished place in freezer, but check with Marisa first.

* With remaining sample, agitate sample in ISCO bottle and pour into volumetric flask and recording amount. Pull measured amount of sample through *ashed, pre-weighted, 47mm GF/F filters*.  **Because initial samples will have more sediment, start out filtering smaller measured amounts of sample. Through visual inspection, you will get a better understanding of how much to begin with, but 50mL is a good place to start. If sample is particularly heavy with sediment, start with 25mL.**

* When you notice the _ashed, pre-weighed 47mm GF/F filter_ is getting clogged, remove the filter and place the filter in the marked Aluminum pan. **Don't forget to record the amount of sample that was pulled through the filter on the lab datasheet.**

* Replace the pre-weighed, ashed filter with another ashed filter and rinse with a small amount of sample, then discard filtrate. This filter does not/should not be pre-weighed. The amount of sample pulled through these filters does not need to be recorded.

* Note: If you are able to pull 100mL of sample through the initial filter, give the DOC vial a good rinse, at least 20mL and fill with 40mL. Rinse each Falcon tube with remainder.
