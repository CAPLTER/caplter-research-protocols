**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** Root core processing

**Purpose**

This SOP covers the procedure for processing root cores at the Tres Rios
wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

Sharp rocks or other objects in the samples may present cutting hazards
to hands, arms, or skin.

**Required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

- N/A

**Materials**

- PVC tube, sharpened at one end

- Metal file

- Trowel

- Sharp, serrated knife

- Large garden shears

- Sledgehammer

- Sharpie

- Box of 1-gallon zip-lock plastic bags

**Procedure – Aboveground samples**

1.  Rinse samples using DI water to remove any excess dirt or extraneous
    material

2.  Use clippers to cut plant tissue into small (~1-2 inch) sections for
    easy placement in drying tins/ovens

3.  Dry samples at 60 C until constant weight (approx. 3-5 days)

4.  Record sample mass (for below ground to above ground biomass
    ratios).

5.  Homogenize the plant material using either a) mortar & pestle or b)
    food processor.

6.  Take three representative replicate sub-samples (~handful of plant
    material) and run them through the Wiley Mill using a size 40 or
    greater screen.

    1.  Ensure that the sub-samples are similar in weight and
        composition

7.  Store milled sample in clean, sealed sample bags or scintillation
    vials. Split sample approximately in half into two bags: one for
    nutrient analysis, and another for archive.

    1.  Ensure that the halves are similar in weight and composition.

8.  Samples may have to be ball milled (at Goldwater Environmental Lab)
    before nutrient analysis. See ball mill protocol.

9.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the equipment in between samples.

**Procedure – Belowground samples**

1.  Thoroughly rinse samples using DI water to remove any excess dirt or
    extraneous material.

    1.  Use hands to gently massage clumps of dirt, organic matter, or
        clay away from plant root tissues and root fibers.

2.  Use clippers to cut plant tissue into small (~0.5 to 1 inch)
    sections for easy placement in drying tins/ovens

3.  Dry samples at 60 C until constant weight (approx. 3-5 days)

4.  Record sample mass (for below ground to above ground biomass
    ratios).

5.  Homogenize the plant material using either a) mortar & pestle or b)
    food processor.

6.  Take three representative replicate sub-samples (~handful of plant
    material) and run them through the Wiley Mill using a size 40 or
