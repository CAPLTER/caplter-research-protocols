**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** Root core extraction

**Purpose**

This SOP covers the procedure for extracting root cores at the Tres Rios
wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

Sharp tools and objects in the soil may present cutting hazards to
hands, arms, or skin.

**Required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

- Gardening gloves (optional), protective coverings for sharps

**Materials**

- PVC tube, sharpened at one end

- Metal file

- Trowel

- Sharp, serrated knife

- Large garden shears

- Sledgehammer

- Sharpie

- Box of 1-gallon zip-lock plastic bags

- Cooler

- Ice packs

**Procedures**

1.  Before heading to the field, use metal file to ensure edges of
    coring cylinder are sharp. Sharpen as needed while in the field.

2.  Pre-Label bags with the following information: 1) Tres Rios, 2)
    species code and sample \# (e.g. TYP2), 3) date, and 4) plant part
    (e.g. Aboveground or Belowground)

    1.  If multiple bags are necessary, modify the “plant part” label to
        also include bag \# information.

        1.  Ex: Tres Rios TYP2 11/2/17 AG1/2 *and* Tres Rios TYP2
            11/2/17 AG2/2

3.  3 cores are to be taken of each of the following species: *Typha
    spp.*, *S. californicus,* and *S. acutus/S. tabernaemontani.*

    1.  9 cores total.

    2.  Cores should be taken at different locations within the marsh
        and throughout the whole system.

4.  Look for a plant specimen that is fairly “clean” – i.e. not deeply
    entangled with surrounding plants, relatively isolated, relatively
    normal phenotype.

5.  Using garden shears, clip the plant just above the soil surface.
    This will be the aboveground (AG) sample.

6.  Keeping sample intact and ensuring no sample mass is lost, place
    aboveground (AG) sample into its designated labeled bag.

    1.  Plant can be clipped, bent or folded as necessary to fit inside
        of zip-lock bags.

7.  Returning to the plant specimen, place coring tube over the
    remaining belowground (BG) plant sample, making sure to place the
    plant as close to the center of the tube as possible

8.  Use your hands and the hammer to drive the cylinder into the soil to
    the desired depth.

    1.  While dropping the hammer, it is helpful to keep a firm downward
        pressure on the core assembly to minimize soil disturbance.

    2.  Hammer in a circular motion around the circumference of the tube
        to ensure even insertion.

    3.  Make extensive use of the serrated knife or other sharp cutting
        tools to “slice” through any attached roots or rhizomes along
        the outside edge of the tube if the tube feels stuck.

9.  Excavate around the cylinder and gently rock it in a circular motion
    (approx. 20-30 degrees from vertical) to loosen.

10. Once cylinder is loosened, insert a hand, shovel or trowel under the
    cylinder to further ensure that the plant and associated root mass
    does not fall out the bottom of the core and provide leverage.

11. Gently lift the core out of the sampling location.

12. Gently rinse away excess soil from the roots of the plant sample.
    Deposit cleaned roots into its designated labeled bag.

13. Return samples to the field truck and store them in a cooler with
    ice packs. Upon returning to campus, samples can be kept in the cold
    room.
