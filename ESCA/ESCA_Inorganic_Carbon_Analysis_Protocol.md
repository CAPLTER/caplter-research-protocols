Reagent: 6M HCl with 3% by weight FeCl2.4H2O
To a 1 liter volumetric flask, add 30g FeCl2.4H2O + 500mL conc HCl. Allow to cool. Dilute to mark and mix.


### **Procedure:**

Weigh 1g of sample or standard into serum bottle, either 20mL or 100mL, depending on sensitivity desired. Sherrod et al (2002) suggest screening samples by using a 1 hour reaction time with a 0.25g sample size in the 100mL bottle, and them evaluating the voltage produced. This is fine as long as there is enough sample. As long as your samples are less than 1.8% IC, it is probably safe to use the 20mL bottle. With higher concentrations you risk cracking and possibly shattering the bottle.

Carefully add vial containing 2mL of 6M HCl reagent to serum bottle with tweezers. Periodically rinse tweezers to keep from corroding. Wear gloves, glasses, and lab coat.

Place septum on bottle top, them aluminum seal. Seal with crimpers. Take care not to spill acid.

Agitate bottle to knock over vial so that acid comes in contact with sample. Ensure that acid and sample are well-mixed. Allow bottle to sit overnight.

Measure voltage of sample as follows:

Turn on power supply to pressure transducer.

Turn on multimeter. Press range button until you are in volts. Press max/min button. Display should indicate max. In this mode the maximum voltage reading is displayed.

Remove tear-out portion of bottle seal and pierce with needle hooked up to pressure transducer. Record voltage displayed on multimeter. Turn off meter between sample measurements to clear out the old reading.


Notes:

One standard curve should be run with each batch of samples. Use the appropriate standard range for the sensitivity desired:

20mL bottle:  0.03, 0.06, 0.12, 0.24, 0.6, 1.2, 1.8 % IC std

100mL bottle: 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, 6.0 % IC std


The method detection limit (MDL) for the 20mL bottle is 0.017% inorganic C. For the 100mL bottle the MDL is 0.042% inorganic C. For samples with inorganic C content of less than 1%, use the 20mL bottle. For 1% or greater, use the 100mL bottle.

Rinse bottles and vials in tap water, acid wash prior to use.

**Important:** Replace syringe needle after every sample run. Acid fumes cause buildup of corrosion inside the needle, which restricts flow and reduces sensitivity.
