**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** IRGA Transpiration – Data Entry

**Purpose**

This SOP covers the lab procedures for transferring and entering data
from field measurements of transpiration using IRGA at Tres Rios
wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

None

**Materials**

- IRGA and batteries

- Gray LICOR 6400 cord

- LICOR 6400 X Term computer app

- tr-irga-fielddata.csv file

**Procedures**

Data transfer

Tip: freeze top row in the datasheets you are working with to avoid
mistakes and use Paste Special Values to avoid number changes between
files

- Insert batteries and turn on IRGA

- Connect one end of the LICOR 6400 cord to the port on the IRGA and
  connect the other side to the computer USB port.

- Turn on the IRGA and scroll over to select “Tres Rios configurations”.
  It will ask if the chamber is connected, type “Y”

- The IRGA will be showing the main screen. Press “L” to sync with the L
  Term. You can confirm this by looking on the right side of the screen
  where the selected term will be displayed.

- Open the “LICOR6400Xterm” computer app

- At the top left-hand corner, switch from “Ethernet” to “RS-232”. In
  the next box over, select “usbserial” and connect. You will see the
  light on the LICOR 6400 cord flash blue.

- Click the “File exchange” tab in the top left corner.

- In the right-side box, press the play button “ \> / ” to load the
  dropdown menu user config (i.e. data stored) then find the desired
  file in .xls format.

- Drag and drop selected file into the ASU WEEL dropbox folder LiCor
  EnteredData

Data entry

- Open dropbox file “tr_irga_fielddata.csv” (WEEL tres rios datasets
  tr-water-budget data)

- Freeze the top row to avoid mistakes when entering data.

- Enter in the date to match the amount of IRGA observations. The rest
  of the data entries will be copied and pasted over from the original
  IRGA file that was transferred onto the computer.

- In the original IRGA file, hide the following rows so you are only
  looking at what you need:

Aux2 (G) – Ebal(I)

CTleaf (O)

BLC1 (Q)

Press (AF) – CrdTotal (BA)

CndCO2 (BD) – Ahs/Cs (BI)

- Here is what should be left:

Obs (A) – plant sp (F)

Photo (J) – Vpdl (N)

Area (P)

Stemrat (R) - PARo (AE)

Vp_kpa (BB) – VpdA (BC)

- Copy and paste values from the original file to their respected row on
  the tres rios file. Be sure to Paste Special Values (control +
  command + V, V) so it is certain the numbers don’t change between
  files.

- Double check to make sure all values line up and save your work!
