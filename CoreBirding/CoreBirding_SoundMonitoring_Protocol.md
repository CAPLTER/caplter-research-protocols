# **Sound Monitoring Protocol (Sound Level Readings)**


Equipment: Exetech 407727 Digital Sound Level Meter (40 to 130 dB measurement range)


## Procedure:

1. Upon arriving at the birding location, set up the tripod with the sound meter deployed horizontally at approximately chest height by extending the bottom set of legs on the tripod.

2. Point the meter such that the microphone (narrow end of the meter) is directed toward the most pronounced source of noise at the site. This will be obvious at some sites (e.g., next to a road), ambiguous at others (e.g., open desert), and often subjective (e.g., road noise versus some other noisy activity). For sites where there is no obvious source of noise (e.g., open desert), point the meter in any direction. Most important is to note the source of noise (or lack thereof) on the datasheet for that site.

3. Turn the meter on by pressing the 'ON / OFF' button. The meter will run through a brief self-calibration check; rapidly changing values (or 'LO' if in a quiet environment) will be displayed on the screen when the meter is ready to record.

4. Be sure the meter is configured with the appropriate settings:

   * Range = 'AUTO'

   * 'AUTO' is displayed in the top left corner of the screen; change by pressing and holding the 'RANGE' button.

   * Response rate = 'FAST'

   * 'FAST' is displayed in the top right corner of the screen; change by pressing the 'FAST / SLOW/ button.

   * Weighting = 'A'

   * 'A' is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen between 'FAST' and 'dB'; change by pressing the 'A / C WEIGHTING' button.

_Note: These settings will not change once they are set initially but get in the habit of checking quickly before each recording to be sure._


5. When you are ready to bird, stand behind the meter and press 'RECORD' to being recording. 'REC' will be displayed in the top-left corner while the meter is recording; the meter will note the highest and lowest sound levels while recording.

6. Note the time on the datasheet and begin the point count.

7. At the end of the point count, note the time on the datasheet and press 'RECORD'. The meter will no longer be recording, and 'MIN' will be displayed in the top-center of the screen; the value on the screen is the minimum sound level during the recording session. 'LO' is displayed for values below 40 dB.

8. Note the minimum sound level on the datasheet.

9. Press 'RECORD' again. 'MAX' will be displayed in the top-left corner of the screen next to 'REC'; the value on the screen is the maximum sound level during the recording session.

10. Note the maximum sound level on the datasheet.

11. Confirm that the start and end times have been recorded on the datasheet, and be sure all entries on the datasheet are completed.

12. Turn off the meter before recording at the next site! This step is necessary to clear the memory.

_Notes:_

* The sound level recording should correspond to the 15-minute point count at each site. If you are disturbed during the point count (for example, a passerby stops to chat during the point count), stop the recording by pressing once on the record button (this will display the 'MIN' recorded up to this point). Also, do not forget to stop your timer that is keeping track of the 15 minutes for the bird count. Once you are ready to resume the count, press twice on the record button. The first time you press it, it will display the 'MAX' recorded up to this point; the second press will resume the recording. Do not forget also to start your timer to resume the countdown to 15 minutes for the bird count. Note the times on the datasheet, and make notes of what happened.

* Important: Turn the meter off to clear the memory before performing another recording!

* Of course, be quiet during the recording.

* If for any reason the sound meter turns off on its own during the count and you do not notice it until the end, record 5 minutes post count and make a note of what happened.
