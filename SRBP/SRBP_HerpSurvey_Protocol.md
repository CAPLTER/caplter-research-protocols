## **Prior to start of survey:**

* Use the contact list documentated/updated in Dropbox (ASU) \research\SRBP\Survey&ReachInfo\AllSites_ImpContactInfo to contact the appropriate agencies before/upon exiting the reaches, as necessary when scheduling the surveys. Make sure the necessary permits are in place for either displaying in the vehicle or keeping with field paperwork. Also make sure to have the proper gate keys/codes, if needed.

* Alternate the order in which you survey the plots each season, as documented in Dropbox (ASU) \research\SRBPSurvey&ReachInfo\SurveyDates&Order. Also alternate the direction (north vs. south) in which you start surveying a plot from that done in the previous season. This is not documented, so use memory from previous surveys or start at the plot endpoint that makes sense when approaching from the previous plot. Due to water/vegetation, some plots can only be accessed from one direction.


## **Required survey conditions:**

* Although full sun is the ideal weather condition for herp surveys, mostly sunny is acceptable for the May and September surveys. Partly cloudy is acceptable for the June survey since the ambient temperature is warmer. However, note that regardless of how warm the ambient temperature is, the presence of the sun is generally still necessary for herps to be active. Do not survey under mostly cloudy or cloudy conditions.

* Start in the morning after sunrise once the temperature reaches a minimum of 70 deg F and sunlight is hitting surfaces on the ground (i.e., when you feel warmth on your skin and rocks are getting warm to the touch). Detecting herp activity in the reach on the way from the vehicle to the first plot is ideal for confirming herps are active for surveying.

* Weather conditions at the start of the survey can be recorded in the Comments section of the datasheet. Remember, it can be too hot to survey. You should be done surveying when the rocks are getting hot to the touch (i.e., difficult to leave your bare hand on for long), as this means it is also getting too hot for herps to be active.

* Winds should be below approximately 15mph (i.e., moderate breeze that will make small branches move).


## **Day of survey (for Priest and Price sites only)**

* Before entering the river bottom at Priest Drive, call the Water Operations Control Center at (480) 350-2669 (taking care not to schedule this site during a rainy period) and again after leaving (i.e., check-in and check-out).

* After leaving the river bottom at Price Drain, be sure and email Erik Arntz (erikarntz@mail.maricopa.gov), Tony Peters (tonypeters@mail.maricopa.gov) and Robert Coutts (RobertCoutts@mail.maricopa.gov) to let them know that you are safely out. Note: these same three people should have been contacted a few days to your visit for approval to visit the site on the planned day.


## **While walking the reach but not surveying:**

* Record all herp species seen while walking the reach in the Reach-level Observations section of the datasheet. This includes all herp species seen in the riparian area upon arrival, upon departure, or in between surveys. Species that are detected during the plot surveys do not also need to be listed in the Reach-level Observations.


## **Conducting the survey:**

* Approach the plot slowly. Be thoughtful on how you approach the plot and **do NOT walk in the plot prior to starting the survey**. As you approach and start seeing the plot from a distance, look for any herp movement in the plot. If you locate a herp in the plot while approaching, record it in the plot survey even if you have not recorded the start time for your survey yet.

* Once you have reached one endpoint of the plot, remain approximately 5-10m away from the whisker. Each observer should position him/herself 2.5m on each side of the centerline (which is approximately the length of an outstretched arm holding a hiking pole), in front of his/her respective half of the plot, i.e., each observer surveys a 5m width measured from the centerline, for a total survey width of 10m. If vegetation or other obstructions are in the way, you may adjust the observation position slightly for a better view; some plots are so thickly vegetated that you may only be able to see a portion of the plot.

* Start and record the survey time once both observers are in position.

* Both observers scan the plot with eyes **and binoculars** to look for active or basking herps. Herps are very cryptic, and it is easy to miss the smaller ones by looking only with your eyes. Scan for herps that are on the group, on rocks, on logs, on tree trunks and branches (up to ~2m in height), etc. Both observers should scan the entire plot, not just his/her half. By standing in different locations, each observer has a different view of the plot and thus may see a herp that the other observer cannot see, even if the other observer is closer to it.

* Once both observers are done scanning, they should both start searching the plot at the same time, walking roughly at the same pace, to increase the chances of seeing fleeing herps. Each observer is responsible for searching half of the plot, a 5m-wide-by-20m-long area. Observers can identify the centerline of the plot by the flagging, whereas each endpoint is marked with a whisker and pin flag and/or double-flagged vegetation or rocks.

* When searching the plot, **do NOT destroy vegetation, collapse burrows, or rip apart debris piles. This is a non-invasive/non-destructive survey**. These features are an integral part of the plot and will need to be surveyed in future seasons.

   * Visually search shrubs, tree trunks, branches, and any vertical structure up to ~2m in height.

   * With a stick, such as a hiking pole, shake and poke into shrubs, debris piles, bunch grasses, grasses, even tiny annuals (i.e., search through ALL vegetation). Herps often hide at the base of shrubs, which are often dense and where burrow openings are present.

   * Flip rocks at your discretion, but put them back as you find them; herps are often found under chunks of urbanite (i.e., concrete and asphalt) due to their irregular surfaces. Do not flip rocks that are well-embedded in the ground, as this could destroy habitat.

   * As you walk, keep scanning ahead, but also behind you.

   * Be very careful not to count the same herp twice; keep track of where they are.

   * When a herp is seen and identified, record and enumerate it in the appropriate transect-location box of the datasheet.

* If a herp is seen but unidentified, both observers can tag-team the herp to get a positive identification. To do so, stand on each side of the suspected herp location with one person searching through the vegetation and the other person standing still and looking diligently for any sign of the herp. Ideally, leave an open path between the suspected current location of the herp and where it came from, in hopes that it will go back there. Once a positive identification is achieved, or if you cannot find your herp within a reasonable amount of time, resume the plot search from where you left off.

* If a herp is observed outside the plot, it may be recorded in the Reach-level Observations setion of the datasheet.

* Once observers reach the far end of the plot, they should turn around and scan again with eyes and binoculars. Like the scan done prior to surveying the plot, if vegetation or other obstructions are in the way, you may adjust the observation position slightly for a better view; some plots are so thickly vegetated that you may only be able to see a portion of the plot. **DO NOT** walk back through the plot making additional observations. When both observers are done scanning, stop and record survey time.

* Other observations that can be included as notes inside the survey box include factors that could impact the survey count such as the presence of standing water or saturated soil, disturbances to the plot, presence of a predator, or changes to the plot. If notes are for the reach itself and not for a plot survey, then they should go in the Comments section of the datasheet.

* When recording all herps, one may include qualifying observations such as YOY (young of fear = hatchlings); or other physical traits or habitat notes that you think might help with identification after the survey.
