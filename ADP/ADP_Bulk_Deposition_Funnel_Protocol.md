# **ADP Bulk Deposition Funnel Collector**

Updated July 2020

Bulk deposition samples are collected along with ADP wet buckets. If there has been no precipitation during the month, then the funnel and sample bottle should be inspected for damage and, if necessary, replaced with clean ones when the ADP dry bucket is collected. During periods of heavy rainfall, the sample bottle should be collected before it overflows.

Funnels are acid washed with 10% HCl prior to installation. Sample collection bottles are 1gal bottles that have been acid washed with 10% HCl. Once clean and dry, weigh the sample bottle with its cap on on the 12kg balance in GWC 681. Write its weight and ID on the side of the bottle with a Sharpie. The collected sample is routed through looped Tygon tubing between the funnel and bottle and forms a vapor trap to prevent evaporation of the sample. Tygon tubing running from the sample bottle to a 4oz bottle containing nanopure water provides a second vapor trap but allows the sample bottle to breathe during precipitation collection.

In order to prevent bird droppings or insects from entering the funnel and contaminating the sample, a 17in x 17in piece of 10% HCl-washed fiberglass screen is tied to the top of the funnel using thin wire. Additionally, a small 2cm square of 10% HCl-washed blue aquarium filter is placed in the bottom of the funnel on top of the stopper.

Clean funnels are placed in 13gal garbage bags and stored with ADP buckets. Clean 1gal sample bottles are stored in the same area. Other supplies (thin wire, 4oz bottles, Tygon tubing, stoppers, cable ties, Velcro, nanopure water rinse bottle, spare quick connects, screens, and aquarium filters) are stored in a sweater box in the cabinet where the ADP backpack is kept in GWC 639.

The bulk deposition funnel collector is located on the roof of LSA. Access is via a locked gate. The key to the roof lock is kept in the desk drawer in GWC 681 and is labeled "LSA Roof" with white lab tape.


### **Sample collection:**

Inspect funnel for contamination (e.g., bird droppings, insects). If present, continue with the sample collection and funnel/bottle replacement procedures, but discard the contaminated sample. Do not prepare it for analysis.

Replace the screen-covered funnel with a clean one that has been acid washed. Wear nitrile gloves when handling replacement funnels to minimize Na contamination. Also, replace the aquarium filter and rubber stopper in the neck of the funnel with ones that have been acid washed.

Disconnect the tubing from the funnel at the quick connect (on the 1gal bottle cap) and pour about 250mL of nanopure water into the funnel to rinse the tubing. Reconnect the tubing when finished.

Unscrew the cap of the replacement 1gal bottle; put the cap from this bottle on the sample bottle. Put the new bottle on the stand and replace the cap. The easiest way to do this is to screw the bottle onto the cap, making sure the seal is tight. Record the sample bottle number and weight on the ADP field datasheet under "Buckets" under site "Fun". The "Lid" portion of the field sheet will not be used. Note any contaminants on the funnel (e.g. bird droppings, insects) under "Contaminants" on the field sheet. Remember to discard contaminated samples.

Inspect the 4oz bottle and replace with a new one half-filled with nanopure water if necessary. Reuse the holed cap. Make sure the Tygon tubing extends down into the water.

When replacing tubing, bring one 18in-long piece to connect from the funnel to the 1gal bottle and another 23in-long piece to connect from the 1gal bottle to the 4oz bottle. Make sure the tubing that connects the funnel and the 1gal bottle is looped to form a vapor trap. Secure both pieces of tubing to the PVC frame.

Weigh the capped 1gal sample bottle on the 12kg balance in GWC 681 and record the weight on the ADP field datasheet.

Samples should be refrigerated if not processed right away.

Process samples the same as an ADP wet bucket sample.


### **Maintenance:**

Funnels and bottles may become brittle and crack due to repeated acid washings and outdoor exposure. They should be discarded and replaced with new ones.

Tygon tubing will become yellowed and start to break down from outdoor exposure. Dirt may accumulate along the walls of the tubing and algae may also start to grow and discolor the tubing. Replace the tubing at the first sign of any of the above.
