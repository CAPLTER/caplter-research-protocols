**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** Aboveground Primary Productivity – Data Entry

**Purpose**

This SOP covers the field procedures for entering data from field
measurements of aboveground primary productivity at the Tres Rios
wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

None

**Materials**

- Data book

- tr-agpp-data.csv excel sheet

**Procedures**

- Freeze top row (date, transect, quadrat, etc.) to avoid mistakes when
  entering data

- For each individual plant entry, ensure that the date, transect,
  quadrat, and species type match what is written in the book.

- Initial each page in the data book once it is entered and verified.

- Tip: count the total number of plants per quadrat and transect and
  fill in rows A-B to match that amount before entering data. This will
  help you catch any mistakes or non-entries that were mixed up between
  plants.

**<u>Typha spp.</u>**

**Typha latifolia** (enter as “t_latifolia”)

Species Code: TLAT

Metrics of interest:

- CDB (enter in column E)

- Length of individual leaves (enter in columns H to AC)

Special exception: If pistillate (flower) is present, don’t enter any
leaf data. Instead:

- Total stem height (enter in column F)

- Pistillate length (L) and width (W) (enter in column AD and AE)

**Typha domingensis** (enter as “t_domingensis”)

Species Code: TDOM

Metrics of interest:

- CDB (enter in column E)

- Length of individual leaves (enter in columns H to AC)

Special exception: If pistillate (flower) is present, don’t enter any
leaf data. Instead:

- Total stem height (enter in column F)

- Pistillate length (L) and width (W) (enter in column AD and AE)

**<u>Schoenoplectus spp.</u>**

**Schoenoplectus californicus** (enter as “s_californicus”)

Species Code: SCAL

Metrics of interest:

- CDB (enter in column E)

- Total stem height (enter in column F)

Special exception: If seeds are present, enter number of seeds in column
G

**Schoenoplectus acutus, or Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani** (enter as
“s_acutus”)

Species Code: SAC/STAB, or SS

Metrics of interest:

- CDB (enter in column E)

- Total stem height (enter in column F)

Special exception: If seeds are present, enter number of seeds in column
G

**<u>OTHER</u>**

If data book shows a quadrat that says “THATCHED”, “AIRBOAT TRAIL,” or
“OPEN WATER,” please only enter the date, transect, and quadrat
information and then input the corresponding note into the Notes column
(column AG). Leave all other cells blank

**Tips**

1.  Be sure to save often (at least once after each page of data
    entered)

2.  Be sure species names are entered exactly as described above into
    column D. Any spaces or extra characters will cause the biomass
    model to not calculate plant biomass.
