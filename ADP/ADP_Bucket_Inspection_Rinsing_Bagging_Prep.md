# **ADP Bucket Inspection/Rinsing, Bagging and New Bucket Prep**

Updated July 2020  

### **Inspection:**

* Wipe any moisture, dirt, or debris off the outside of all buckets and lids with a dry paper towel.
* Inspect buckets/lids for cracks, chips, stains, and rust on the bucket handle. If the weight appears to have changed by these means but the buckets/lids are still good, be sure to reweigh the buckets/lids with the 12kg balance in GWC 681, relabel with a Sharpie, and circle any defects. The buckets also change weight over time due to outdoor exposure. It is useful to reweigh any used buckets every few months to make sure the weights are accurate; relabel with a Sharpie if necessary.  
* Check that the ID and weights are still visible and legible. If necessary, rewrite with a Sharpie.


### **Rinsing:**

* Put on a pair of nitrile gloves and thoroughly rinse them with nanopure water.
* Rinse the exterior of the bucket/lid with nanopure water to loosen any contamination. Use a small scrub brush if necessary.
* Rinse the interior of the bucket/underside of the lid with nanopure water.
* Rinse a natural sponge thoroughly with nanopure water then wipe the interior surface. Use a small scrub brush if necessary.
* Rinse the bucket interior surface with nanopure water four times, 1/4 turn between each rinse.
* Set the bucket upside down on the drying cart or on paper towels on the counter. Place the lid similarly on the drying cart/paper towels with the underside facing downward.
* Buckets/lids will dry within 24hr if air is allowed to circulate inside (e.g., by leaning on a  neighboring bucket/lid or overhanging a counter's edge a bit).


### **Bagging:**

* Using 13gal garbage bags for buckets and 4gal garbage bags for lids, place the buckets/lids into new plastic garbage bags by using the outside of the bags as gloves.
* Buckets should have the open end towards the bottom of the bag.
* Squeeze the air out of the bag and close with a twist tie.


### **New bucket prep:**

* Clean new buckets/lids as described above under "Rinsing".
* Fill the bucket with distilled water. While filling, add 1mL of 0.6N HNO<sub>3</sub> solution (38.2mL concentrated HNO<sub>3</sub>/L) using a rinsed pipet tip. Fill the bucket to 2cm below the rim.
* Place a clean lid on top of the bucket and set aside for 7 days to leach.
* After 7 days, clean the bucket/lid again as described under "Rinsing".
* Weigh the bucket/lid with the 12kg balance in GWC 681, recording the ID and weight with a Sharpie twice on the side and once on the bottom of the bucket/twice on the side and once on the top of the lid.
