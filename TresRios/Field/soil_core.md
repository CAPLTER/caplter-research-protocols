**Wetlands Ecosystem Ecology Lab (WEEL)**

**Standard Operating Procedure**

**Project:** Tres Rios Wetlands

**Procedure:** Soil Core Extraction

**Purpose**

This SOP covers the field procedures for extracting soil cores at the
Tres Rios wetlands.

**Potential Hazards**

Sharp tools and objects in the soil may present cutting hazards to
hands, arms, or skin.

**Materials**

- 

- Metal coring cylinder (with cap)

- Metal file

- Box of 1-gallon zip-lock plastic bags

- Coring cylinder plunger

- Cooler

- Ice packs

- Trowel

- Sharpie

**Procedures**

1.  Before heading to the field, use metal file to ensure edges of
    coring cylinder are sharp. Sharpen as needed while in the field.

2.  Pre-label sample bags for each of the soil core samples with the
    following information: 1) Tres Rios, 2) transect and sample location
    (e.g., shore, water), 3) date.

3.  Soil cores are to be taken at 6 locations around the system. These
    include the shore and open-water ends of the following transects:
    M1E, M4S, and M4N.

    1.  At each location, soil cores are to be taken in spots that lack
        vegetation and where soils are easily accessible.

4.  Clean litter from the soil surface so that the cylinder can pass
    freely into the mineral soil.

5.  Drive the cylinder into the soil to the desired depth. While
    dropping the hammer, it is helpful to keep a firm downward pressure
    on the core assembly to minimize soil disturbance.

6.  Once cylinder has reached desired length, place cap on top end of
    cylinder to create a vacuum seal and prevent soils from loosening.

7.  Excavate around the cylinder (especially when a cylinder without a
    sleeve and hammer is used) and gently rock it in a circular motion
    (approx. 20-30 degrees from vertical) to loosen.

    1.  Check to make sure that the soil level inside the core is the
        same as outside. If it is noticeably lower, then compaction has
        occurred and one should consider discarding the core. If
        compaction is minor and limited to within the core, bulk density
        and derivative values will not be compromised; if, on the other
        hand, compaction has pushed soil below the core tip, then bulk
        density will be underestimated.

8.  Once the cylinder is loosened, insert a hand, shovel or trowel under
    the cylinder to further ensure that the soil does not fall out the
    bottom of the core and provide leverage.

9.  Gently lift the core out of the sampling location. Keep the cylinder
    upright.

10. Uncap the cylinder and pour off excess water from cylinder. Stop
    immediately when visible organic matter (dark, chunky material)
    begins to appear.

11. Using a “plunger”-like object (slightly smaller than the coring
    cylinder), push the core from the bottom of the cylinder (most
    stable) out through the top of the cylinder and into its designated
    labeled bag.

    1.  As core emerges, place the ziplock bag over the coring cylinder
        so no sample is lost. The seam of the ziplock bag will also
        allow it to gently rest on a horizontal surface.

    2.  It is critical that you maintain the integrity and orientation
        of the core, and do not disturb or lose excess organic matter
        from the top of the core.

    3.  Note the top-bottom orientation of the core and documenting
        appropriate metadata on sample bag.

12. Return samples to the field truck and store them in a cooler with
    ice packs. Upon returning to campus, samples can be kept in the cold
    room.
