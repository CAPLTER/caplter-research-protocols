## **Plot maintenance (to do just prior to May/June and September surveys):**

* Each site consists of nine plots (20m x 10m) arranged along three transects, upstream, midstream, and downstream. Visit every plot at every reach and refresh the plot endpoints and centerlines, reflag access routes (where needed), and trim vegetation along access routes and in plot (where needed) so that traveling to and through the plots is more visible and efficient. A herp survey should never be done on the same day as plot maintenance.

* Colored whiskers are hammered into the ground and are used as "permanent" markers for plot endpoints. Check whiskers and make sure they are present and not too brittle. If they are too brittle, they will not last until the next season, so remove/replace as recessary. In some cases, it is easier to leave existing whiskers in place and hammer in a second whisker next to the existing one. Those in the shade will last longer than those degraded by sunlight.

* Whiskers can be difficult to see, so use pin flags in addition to whiskers to mark plot endpoints. Replace pin flags as needed. Pin flags can sometimes be difficult to install firmly in rocky soils and if not installed firmly will blow away. A properly installed pin flag should not come out of the ground with a light tug. For locations where pin-flag installation is especially difficult, wet the soil before insertion, install the flag firmly, then rewet the soil to cement it in. In heavy vegetation, tie two pieces of same-colored flagging on vegetation (e.g., branch or tall grass) above a whisker and pin flag so they are easier to locate. If whiskers and pin flags cannot be set, use two rocks tied with same-colored flagging as the end of the plot centerline. Whiskers, pin flags, double-flagged vegetation, and double-flagged rocks all signify the location of an endpoint.

* If one whisker is missing, re-measure the plot (20m) from the other existing whisker. Use the transect bearing to orient the plot, locate the second endpoint on the centerline at 20m using a tape measure, and install a new whisker and pin flag (note: the measuring tape and bearing may help you locate the missing whisker, look 1-2 meters in either direction of point).

* If both whiskers are missing, use the GPS point to locate one endpoint of the plot centerline and install new whisker and pin flag. Use the transect bearing to orient the plot, locate the second endpoint on the centerline at 20m, and install second new whisker and pin flag.

* If needed, reflag the plot centerline with same-colored flagging so that it is easily seen during the surveys. This is done to allow the surveyors to easily identify and survey their respective halves of the plot. Flagging is best done with two people. Standing at opposite ends of the plot, directly above the whiskers/pin flags, face each other and mentally mark the centerline of the plot. Starting at each end and working towards each other, tie flagging on vegetation located along the centerline. If no vegetation is available, tie flagging around a single rock. When complete, go back to the plot endpoints and double check the linear accuracy of the centerline, adjusting rocks and vegetation as needed. Existing flagging can be left in place if still located on the centerline, but old flagging or flagging that has fallen on the ground should be removed and discarded.

* Verify all plots are accessible and passable and, if needed, trim vegetation to provide a small path to walk to and through the plot. If possible, use flagging of a different color to denote access routes and obstructions (e.g., roots and rebar sticking out).
